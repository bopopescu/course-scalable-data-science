officials promising that there would reprise california chaos but consumer advocates while generally agreeing that the texas plan included better safeguards that california expressed skepticism that residential customers would benefit from long term price reductions energy providers compete for business these advocates also warned that texas like california had failed provide adequate protections ensure that the state does not suffer from electricity shortages demand increases for texas deregulation comes not long after enron corp the houston based energy giant that championed deregulated energy markets collapsed into bankruptcy meanwhile the chairman the state agency that will oversee the deregulated electricity market has come under political attack for his past ties enron the official launch deregulation texas was new year day but wednesday marked the first business day operation and yet few the million eligible households had chosen switch providers away from the long standing utilities state officials predicted that the transition would gradual particularly for residential customers many whom are still unaware that change afoot nor have electricity retailers rushed into the residential market yet new retailers have registered with the state but most are seeking commercial and industrial clients terry hadley spokesman for the texas public utility commission the agency overseeing the electricity marketplace said electricity retailers are sharpening their pencils see what kind offers they can make several companies are already marketing residential customers hadley predicted that such appeals will intensify coming months adding that officials hope see more companies come into the market will concerned see pullback from what starting out said still uncertain whether texas customers will embrace deregulation particularly after the problems california the new rules texas establish immediate retail price reduction between percent and percent drop partly attributable the low price natural gas which often used fuel electric generation plants this savings built into the price beat the state mandated price per kilowatt hour that the old utilities will allowed charge under deregulation keep their customers new retailers meanwhile will allowed offer lower prices way entice customers switch can compete with the existing price beat said marcie zlotnick spokeswoman for gexa energy new retailer that hopes sign residential customers the houston and dallas metropolitan areas years end she said her company would offer price cents per kilowatt hour versus the price beat cents another company green mountain energy austin which emphasizes wind generated power will actually charge small premium above the price beat texas officials have taken pains reassure consumers and journalists that california problems were unique california the state deregulated the wholesale power market while keeping retail prices capped this caused the state two biggest public utilities lose billions dollars when wholesale prices spiked and the retail price caps prevented them from pushing the costs along consumers one reason that wholesale prices jumped was that the price natural gas was then record high but california officials including gov gray davis also accused several energy companies including enron manipulating prices and exacerbating the state problems charge the companies denied california problems were also partly attributable lack supply the state had not built major power plant roughly decade endured rolling blackouts and other problems before federal regulators last summer ordered restraints electricity prices september the california public utilities commission voted shift away from deregulation since then states such nevada oklahoma and new mexico have postponed plans for deregulation but texas officials have expressed confidence their plan unlike california texas deregulated the wholesale electrical market providing time buffer work out any kinks before introducing retail deregulation this year and also unlike california texas has seen about power plants built the state during the past six years currently officials say the state electrical supply exceeds demand percent nor does the state plan mandate the sort retail price caps that crippled the california utilities have more than enough capacity and supply electricity hadley said and the mechanics are place make adjustments for any dramatic spike fuel costs and are going about this steady approach consumer advocates are more skeptical carol biedrzycki executive director the texas ratepayers organization save energy said the state should have required electricity providers maintain reserve margin electrical capacity roughly percent above demand she believes state officials have inflated power generating capacity and could face problems increasing demand few years order keep the prices stable have have reserve margin she said janee briesemeister senior analyst with the southwest regional office consumers union austin noted the primary selling point deregulation was that would bring lower energy prices consumers but she said group the new retailers have already sought increase the price beat effort that failed she said the relatively small number companies expressing interest the residential market could mean that state regulators may eventually have take some sort action fear that looks like there aren lot companies offering services consumers texas then their reaction will raise prices consumers she said story can end here optional material follows recent weeks the texas public utility commission has been the spotlight because questions whether its chairman max yzaguirre former enron executive appointed gov rick perry misrepresented his connections the company state disclosure forms last month enron was the midst bankruptcy and laying off more than employees yzaguirre

today along the rugged windswept paradise maui phil mickelson absence the mercedes championships has made his status the world ranked player all the more conspicuous has spoken openly about his desire higher those rankings and according one woods closest friends the fact mickelson and woods are not pals should fuel their budding rivalry think have rivalry now with tiger and phil butch harmon woods coach said part that they are not the best friends for whatever reason not like ugly thing they just aren buddies this how rivalries sometimes are born doesn require bitter hatred just basic difference attitude personality look back the best golf rivalry ever jack nicklaus arnold palmer and you find they were never buddy buddy early their careers they were respectful each other but they were never dinner companions until their senior years does mickelson woods have chance according harmon already begun because they are and the world that always going create some sort rivalry between the two guys said what compounds that they are two entirely different personalities with two really different philosophies life there animosity they just don get along that well the rest the guys david duval ernie els and all the rest all get along pretty well there real rivalry there maybe this what the pga tour needs some good old fashioned bad blood stoke the competitive fires would help course mickelson would ever win major even show play since hasn competed pga tour event since the nec invitational august missing the mercedes limited field event for winners tournaments spend time with his family assuming returns later this month mickelson will have waiting for him rejuvenated woods and flock new young players who think they are ready take woods mickelson els and duval woods coming off five win which the only player couldn measure was himself and his wins the two previous seasons says eager get under way after satisfying short offseason think two weeks qualifies enough offseason said adding that actually fresher now than was last year when the season began really excited about playing was fired when got here and even more fired now good feeling know that starting over again from scratch last year this time was worn out because had come off playing eight row this year been able have some breaks get some time off even though only had two weeks off felt longer than that asked what his goals are for woods said same thing want every year win every tournament play becoming obvious that woods and seasons are going rank among the best golf history may never again measure the level that saw him win half the time played but the ongoing debate about whether the gap has closed between woods and the pack sure continue this year think that question you asking said sergio garcia added duval think going into last year all knew would very difficult what did again win half the events that you play during year along with three majors that tough thing going into last year didn think win nine times again and didn just stunk winning only five times with major that woods norm then the rest the tour big trouble even the younger players who are perhaps too young know they should intimidated woods the young stallions who figure force the tour this year are led charles howell iii who earned rookie the year honors last season even though didn have any playing privileges the start the year but not kapalua this week and david gossett the former texas longhorn the winners only field because won the john deere classic last year while playing sponsor exemption gossett thrilled about being the only young gun aside from garcia this week field nice not have worry about any those guys this week because they aren here gossett said but true that the tour getting younger and younger competing with the best players the world and holding our own there one theory tour that the young guns are getting too much credit too soon the first thing worry about getting privileges duval said you have get your playing privileges before you can worry about doing anything else appreciate their attitude but you have take the right steps course howell gossett and others are trying skip few those steps the top and year old tryon the tour will have its youngest player ever this year garcia perhaps the only member the kiddie corps who has legitimate claim included with woods mickelson and garcia two wins could signify ready start tracking down woods already has big designs has said would like lead both the tour and the european tour money earnings didn say going said said like garcia probably the most sincere all the pros when talking about woods knows that where the standard rests when think have chance good that age hopefully better said garcia who turns next week right now just more exciting play when the tournament when tournament gives little extra spicy taste you want beat him beaten him head head last year buick classic almost beat him the pga consider myself challenger him does mickelson but will have wait until later this month either phoenix pebble beach confront woods for the first time woods said surprised mickelson isn the season opening tournament but heard lot different things about what going with his family woods said whatever sure good reason mickelson coming off year when had top finishes compared only nine for woods but that statistical note doesn mean much some think good players guys who are the hall fame don sit around talking about how many top finishes they had harmon said all about winning for them and that how should this game mickelson achievements however coincided with season ending stretch for woods which was out the top eight his last nine tournaments was that late season lull that helped mickelson cause when said the gap had been closed woods phil could have had incredible year last year harmon said was position win six seven eight times really good position and that great accomplishment still you have assume that having been that position and have only won couple times that has frustrating only knows that for sure builds that season however could have another great year and they say the

swordfishes which have valid place career these kinds movies make better because know that they not what expected for the other thing they don even think roles like this black woman her 30s which fits description she notes with chuckle just used the fight that been what career been about that been ingrained since was little and probably has with being raised white mother she always said you going have work harder you going have better you can take for answer and you going have fight perfect for the role berry persistence finally overcame forster reservations wasn necessarily resistance the

torricelli new jersey torricelli democrat one the most accomplished fund raisers congress and the inquiry into his senate campaign deepened became part the rising debate about the role big money politics the heart the investigation were allegations that the senator had illegally accepted tens thousands dollars cash and gifts from campaign contributor exchange for helping the man with foreign business deals but thursday the attorney manhattan mary white said her office had decided end its exhaustive investigation without seeking indictment the information developed the inquiry she said one paragraph statement would referred the senate ethics committee white clinton appointee who stepping down friday declined elaborate her decision the decision was major victory for torricelli who faces election this year and had vowed run again regardless the outcome the investigation already the most prominent republicans the state have decided not run for the senate and many political experts from both parties say that with the threat criminal charges now gone and substantial campaign war chest torricelli will hard beat spent every day trying good senator could but this was lengthy and personally painful experience torricelli said brief written statement plan put this entire matter behind and intend redouble efforts your behalf under its rules the senate ethics committee will open preliminary inquiry into the matter but unclear how aggressively the panel will pursue the case particularly given the political repercussions doing while torricelli campaigns for election and the democrats fight hold single seat majority the senate thursday the senate majority leader tom daschle released statement saying that torricelli had been vindicated the statement made mention the ethics committee story can end here optional material follows the investigation which began four years ago with look into series illegal donations torricelli first senate race quickly came focus eccentric new jersey businessman david chang who turned for help torricelli his local congressman after coming under investigation the justice department campaign financing task force chang admitted june having obstructed justice tampered with federal witness and made more than illegal contributions torricelli candidacy part plea bargain people involved the case said chang told federal investigators had also given torricelli series lavish gifts and tens thousands dollars cash chang purchase some the gifts mentioned expensive watches oriental rug and tailored italian suits was quickly confirmed fbi agents several cases people involved the inquiry said there was also some corroborating evidence that the gifts were delivered torricelli was also revealed that contrary series public statements torricelli his lawyers and his aides went considerable lengths help chang writing letters making introductions and lobbying foreign officials white refused thursday discuss the reasons for her decision and justice department officials said privately that had been her decision alone had white chosen seek torricelli indictment her decision would have had have been approved senior officials the department but several those officials including attorney general john ashcroft had recused themselves from the case avoid conflicts interest torricelli had been the democrats chief fund raiser the senate when ashcroft had unsuccessfully sought election the senate from missouri even before white took over the case from the campaign task force early last year many legal experts had emphasized the difficulty successfully prosecuting sitting politicians cases involving bribery illegal gifts such cases have been especially difficult when the accusers had legal problems their own chang the prosecutors had witness whom they themselves had called liar before agreed plead guilty the senator himself has never denied that accepted gifts from chang but said merely that considered chang friend and that never took any illegal gifts congressional ethics rules allow legislators accept certain gifts from friends when they are limited value and are promptly reported new jersey some torricelli political opponents said thursday that despite the end the criminal investigation they will demand that provide voters more complete explanation than has given thus far voters hold their elected officeholders higher standard said charlie smith campaign manager for james treffinger the essex county executive and republican who running for the senate the questions that existed before today announcement still exist senator torricelli will have ample opportunity address those same questions which has refused answer publicly between now and november torricelli lawyers however said they believed the justice department decision cleared the senator and should put the issue rest this investigation was fueled the false accusations david chang pathological liar and admitted perjurer the lawyers mark pomerantz and theodore wells said written statement while the accusations were well publicized always have been confident that careful and fair investigation chang accusations would result criminal charges but despite his sometimes strange behavior chang built wide network political contacts making generous contributions particularly the democratic party starting around the time befriended torricelli gave more than donations and quickly won invitations state dinners the white house big ticket fund raising events and private audiences the national security council met series times with president clinton whose best friend terry mcauliffe now the democratic national committee chairman hired lobbyist his statements prosecutors chang said had been especially generous torricelli giving him more than cash and gifts that included rolex watch bean shaped cuff links from tiffany amp and inch toshiba television set although torricelli denied ever speaking korean officials about chang business ventures former south korean finance minister confirmed that the senator brought chang along official briefing seoul order lobby for bid that chang was making buy billion life insurance company being sold off the korean government the ambassador later apologized for torricelli actions after white office took over the case last year fbi agents searched torricelli home englewood prosecutors have never said what evidence they produced convince judge sign the search warrant what anything they discovered there the investigation widened and torricelli relationship with chang received extensive coverage the new york times and other newspapers torricelli approval ratings fell several public opinion polls showed but when the summer dragged without any significant movement the case then the sept terrorist

shown that entire class compounds designed inhibit cancer may also without any obvious side effects cause extraordinary weight loss far rupnick now researcher and instructor brigham amp women hospital boston and harvard medical school has conducted her experiments only mice especially called mice which are very fat creatures naturally predisposed eating constantly and thus weighing two three times much normal mouse could long time before her theory tested humans indeed rupnick has not yet even published her findings which she submitted november scientific journal where they are currently under peer review already though rupnick who has received young investigators award from the american heart association for her work and october she received patent which covers the commercial applications her work among rupnick mentors are two maverick investigators judah folkman and robert langer postdoctoral student she worked the laboratory folkman the surgeon and cancer researcher harvard who for decades bucked conventional medical wisdom theorizing that tumors were able grow beyond certain size because they could create their own blood vessels folkman was the first create angiogenesis inhibitor drug designed shrink tumors cutting off their blood supply more than score angiogenesis inhibitors are currently clinical trials and these drugs now are considered among the most promising cancer research about three years ago rupnick started wonder whether the inhibitors might also have effect fat but when she reviewed scientific literature the subject she did not find much but for rupnick fat was fascinating adult whether human mammal have all the blood vessels need she said unless there injury pregnancy new blood vessels are created the highway already built except the case fat adipose tissue fat noncancerous normal tissue that unlike any other tissue the body can grow and regress grow and regress rapidly and substantially depending caloric intake rupnick said rupnick remembers folkman was not initially enthusiastic about her proposal study the vascular structure fat nor was anyone else the conservative response she recalled was what are you crazy you never able get funding one will ever publish your work there are just many charlatan things associated with the market the climate the time was certainly not propitious fen phen popular diet drug combination had recently been pulled from the market because was suspected causing heart valve damage moreover folkman was involved controversy after outside scientists initially were unable replicate his success treating mice tumors attacking the tumors blood supply understandably had concerns about the publicity that her research might generate rupnick said early scientists the national cancer institute said they were able confirm folkman results despite the reservations her colleagues harvard rupnick said langer investigator mit who specializes tissue engineering was intrigued her fat investigations bob langer comes from mit which has very different perspective she said translates and deals with business much more than the medical school does rupnick tested five different angiogenesis inhibitors including tnp angiostatin and endostatin mice and other obese mice the most surprising thing was that not only did the mice stop gaining weight they also lost significant amount weight depending the dose decreased their body weight almost half that enormous rupnick said the drugs were working far better than any approved obesity drug ever had she said the first reaction she got from obesity experts was that the drugs must toxic but rupnick said that normal dosages far she had found evidence toxicity the mice and while the fat tissue shrinks nothing else appears not the brain the heart the liver any other organ nor did the mice seem developing diabetes any other chronic disease why did they lose much weight rupnick theory that the mice whose appetites decreased significantly while the drugs were using the fat fuel that fat goes into their blood stream which where has because has somewhere gets converted into fatty acids and other things that can used fuel she said the animal essentially consumes its own fat for energy don think that toxic all said rupnick who noted nonetheless that would impossible prove that any drug was percent nontoxic angiogenesis inhibitors however can interfere with wound healing and menstruation pregnancy rupnick work suggests that blood vessels fat never seem fully mature but they instead exist special environment that allows them grow retract depending upon the caloric needs the organism this could have much larger implications rupnick who trained cardiologist imagines that one day perhaps blood vessels organs like the heart might

effort the fuel cell partnership its roster includes oil companies such british petroleum and air resources board officials plans demonstrate and test fuel cell vehicles yet automakers say they need

duplicated the amazing shrinking act the silicon machines the power battery depends its volume and scaling down the size while maintaining the power has proved tremendous challenge address the problem handful researchers have turned from traditional fossil fuels electrochemical cells new source create micro and nano size batteries nuclear power the hope that the high energy particles emitted radioactive materials they decay will one day drive generation mems devices james blanchard associate professor nuclear engineering the university wisconsin madison has spent the last three years and about awarded the department energy develop prototypes nuclear microbatteries for mems use blanchard not splitting atoms get his nanonukes which the first thing has learned explain patiently when describing his work people hear nuclear and power and they think fission and explosions said that not what are doing are not splitting uranium instead blanchard and university colleague and mems expert amit lal are using minute amounts radioactive version nickel nickel one the prototypes they have developed this substance decays produces beta particles high energy electrons that now yield nanowatts one nanowatt one billionth watt and may soon the inventors hope yield microwatts this kind technology harnessing radioactive isotopes create power source was used create the far larger

micromachined channels another travels pyramid shape indentations the silicon the relatively low energy emitted beta particles does not damage the semiconductor device where the particles collect the half life the isotope years meaning that that time half the substance will have decayed makes attractive for long term applications blanchard group has also worked with alpha emitting radioisotopes and plans use them for future experiments his work microbatteries was reported last april the ninth international conference nuclear engineering nice france jean pierre fleurial physicist the jet propulsion laboratory pasadena calif oversees several projects that tap the power alpha particles including effort the university illinois alpha particles give off far more energy than beta particles and are therefore promising source said but some prototypes they eventually damage the semiconductor diode where they are collected and converted electricity the work ahead find innovative designs that last long time and are reasonably efficient fleurial said because the research has already yielded several prototypes said confident that alpha particles will eventually yield powerful batteries most the power source technologies don scale down easily explained these the work fleurial and his colleagues was reported last june the 20th international conference thermoelectrics beijing kris

airborne motes silicon that are designed sense measure and transmit data like temperature humidity and light intensity everything getting smaller mems but the batteries said the batteries remain the single heaviest and most expensive part pister said was considering making smart dust that draws its power from the radioactive isotope tritium and that had been approached trace photonics company charleston ill that interested shrinking nuclear batteries smart dust size nuclear batteries can potentially give off staggering amount energy said their longevity also makes them attractive many applications wireless networks are for places you never want back pister said like the foundations tall buildings the walls houses you don want have dig beneath the sheetrock change the batteries what risks might the batteries pose for instance they were scattered through the walls large building monitor air quality temperature they aren likely very dangerous said stephen schwartz publisher the bulletin the atomic scientists unless you ate them threw them the fire and inhaled the smoke most people are still unaware that their smoke detectors contain radioactive materials schwartz said still

the cable television and film units have stellar years the company will still probably have cut hundreds millions dollars costs meet even its lowered expectations for now the most important financial yardstick for aol time warner and most other media companies remains cash flow measured earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda accounting the company had already completed its pending acquisitions bertelsmann percent stake aol europe and ipc european publishing company appears that when aol time warner announces results for later this month will report about billion ebitda the company generate growth the middle its projected range for this year percent then must come with about million additional cash flow where could come from since the merger the financial bedrock aol time warner has been its cable television business which has about million subscribers now that the unit broadly offering cable modem and digital television service features that can generate additional revenue appears set contribute perhaps million additional cash flow this year financially aol time warner lumps its film and television production and distribution operations into what called the filmed entertainment group perhaps the biggest problem that group that reaped around million cash flow selling syndication rights the smash hit seinfeld and friends sitcoms and has nothing comparable stature sell syndication this year that will make tougher for the unit show year over year growth still the unit poised reap bonanza from the home video and dvd releases the popular harry potter and lord the rings films the end enough people will probably want invite wizards and goblins into their homes offset the unit deficit syndication the unit could post perhaps million additional ebitda this year additional million million new cash flow could come from the company publishing operation though magazine advertising remains weak the newly acquired european ipc group which produces titles including loaded and horse amp hound appears doing fairly well but advertising weakness will make difficult for aol time warner cable television networks which include tbs and cnn avoid falloff cash flow and though the warner music group unit trying regain momentum continues struggle along with most the music industry too will well tread water where does this leave the aol internet service which was meant the company growth engine tough spot the recent collapse the unit iplanet joint venture with sun microsystems which was meant help companies expand their internet presence will take about million cash flow away from the aol division the demise iplanet will probably offset reduction losses aol europe perhaps million from about million last year yet the online advertising market anything even worse shape than traditional advertising the internet unit saving grace could that will continue add millions subscribers even aol time warner probably cannot count the unit deliver much more than million million additional cash flow altogether the numbers add about million new cash flow would surprise however see aol cut its costs perhaps million top the reduction aol europe that means total million new cash flow which would just get the company percent ebitda growth the low end its target everything top that would gravy making parsons first year the

thousands tons highly radioactive nuclear waste from power plants and nuclear weapons factories the department has been trying for decades find place dispose the waste piling its bomb factories and

the waste can secured yucca mountain the project faces substantial technical legal and political challenges and could derailed either house congress the courts engineering problems since congress chose the site prime candidate for the burial wastes nevada officials and environmental groups have questioned the ability engineers reliably predict that will not leak significantly for years government rules require the energy secretary spencer abraham added twist the debate thursday saying should consolidate the nuclear wastes enhance protection against terrorist attacks moving them one underground location that far from population centers the project expected cost more than billion president bush approves and other problems block preparation the earliest that waste could stored the mountain officials said but the suitability the site still far from clear some scientists and faces the intense opposition the nevada congressional delegation including harry reid the deputy majority leader simple majority either house could block the project although reid and john ensign the republican senator from nevada said that would difficult reid called the recommendation audacious saying scientific work not complete pointed out that the general accounting office last month said there were issues still studied before the energy department would ready apply the nuclear regulatory commission for license open repository they should just cool till they ready reid said but abraham said thursday that believed that the science behind this project sound and that the site technically suitable for this purpose but the senate majority leader tom daschle said recommendation now would unfortunate and premature ensign who has also vowed fight the project said that the energy department seemed hell bent making yucca mountain the repository matter what scientific studies showed putting the waste nevada has one advantage for the other states means the hot potato went somewhere else and there pressure from some state governments solve the problem operating power reactors around the country are running out storage space spending money extend their storage capacity while the nuclear industry not near building new reactors many plant owners are seeking year extensions their year operating permits john sununu the former white house chief staff and former governor new hampshire

generation responsibility for the stewardship used nuclear fuel and defense waste sununu and ferraro are members committee assembled the chamber commerce push for the opening the yucca site abraham announcement took the form day advance notice the governor nevada required under the nuclear waste law that the department will recommend the site the president disposal nuclear waste has been festering problem for the civilian power industry for years but has drawn more attention since the sept terrorist attacks most the spent fuel stored giant steel lined pools which were intended hold only few years their reactor output but now have decades fuel they are built withstand earthquake tornado and other threats but they were drained terrorist attack experts say that they could burn and spread vast amounts radiation but the decades long argument over what with nuclear waste even the terrorist argument cuts both ways depending who providing the analysis some opponents nuclear power say that the waste not safe where power plants around the country but would even more risk trucks and trains route nevada the mayor las vegas oscar goodman said would oppose the use yucca rallying the mayors cities along the transportation routes said that there were cities with populations least those routes and million people living within half mile the routes the federal effort find place put wastes began the 1960s congress promised have repository open january and the energy department signed contracts with the reactor owners take their wastes beginning that time exchange for payment tenth cent per kilowatt hour generated nuclear power plants since then the government has collected about billion but will least before yucca could open even remains the chosen site the utilities are suing for breach contract often backed their state regulators who say ratepayers have paid for disposal but received nothing return some opponents say that driving hard yucca mountain the department may have taken years long detour down blind alley the institute for environment and energy research arjun makhijani nuclear scientist who specializes studying the energy department said that favored repository but that the chemical conditions yucca mountain were certain cause corrosion the containers and the spread radioactive materials scientists agree that the most likely way that the materials would spread leaking into the water that flows down inside the mountain and then moves underground beneath the desert fact the energy department has learned more about the characteristics the rock has placed more reliance the packaging plans develop for the waste and less the rock itself this has led opponents assert that the project longer the law requires geologic repository but man made one another problem that the department recently belatedly concluded that law firm winston amp strawn that has done much the groundwork for preparing application license the yucca site had conflict interest because was also lobbyist for the nuclear industry the time the choice survives the congress the energy department will have submit application for license the nuclear regulatory commission which must hold hearings and decide whether yucca can contain the wastes for years under rules written last year the environmental protection agency"

washington hotel james carville robert shrum and stan greenberg came armed with polling data suggesting that the bush administration was flailing about with little connection the everyday concerns americans the public was lukewarm toward the new president tax cuts concerned about his close ties corporate america wary his plans drill for oil pristine wilderness alaska doubtful his commitment health care and social security reforms and anxious about the downward spiral the economy but the most astounding finding was that percent believed george bush who came the oval office with frat boy underachiever reputation was over his head the country leader even his worst days with the iran hostage crisis and double digit inflation jimmy carter never had numbers approaching this level greenberg told the reporters all all the democratic strategists concluded the elections looked like good year for democrats chance for the party expand their one seat edge the senate overtake the republicans seat majority the house and with states electing governors add the statehouses controlled the party before the breakfast was over however one the hijacked planes had slammed into one the towers the world trade center new york the group was leaving the hotel word came that another plane had hit the other tower and before they got back their offices third plane had slammed into the pentagon fourth had crashed into the pennsylvania countryside and america was war the war afghanistan and the soaring popularity brought the president have created political landscape that radically different from what has gone before carville shrum and greenberg readily acknowledge now nonetheless they maintain their latest strategy memo democrats that still moment opportunity for the party long democrats focus primarily domestic issues primarily the economy the environment and health care excepting franklin roosevelt democrats party controlling the white house has picked seats first midterm election since the civil war the average loss dozen seats just what the democrats need reinforcing that historical pattern the state the economy there have been eight periods economic contraction since six the eight occurred during midterm election all with republican the white house and those elections the average number house seats lost the president party has been the gop banked offsetting the historic trends with round post census redistricting that leave house republicans with more favorable district boundaries but gains from redistricting have been offset republican retirements far compared only six democrats independent analysts say the republicans can still find hope this year complex political dynamics powerful the historical patterns appear least today things are stacking way that suggest history will not repeat itself political newsletter publisher charles cook informed his subscribers this week for instance this fall senate races also appear favor the democrats they are defending just seats compared for the gop but the democratic incumbents may more vulnerable five them won last time with percent less the vote compared only four the republicans similarly the democrats must defend only governorships this fall while the republicans have statehouses hold but the presidential election bush outperformed gore the states with gubernatorial races this year carrying percent the states with democratic governors while gore was winning percent gop controlled states even the democrats good luck may work against them this fall former republican national committee strategist john pitney now political science professor california said that last year defection sen jim jeffords vermont from the republican party costing his former party control the senate strips the democrats potent argument when one party controls the white house and both chambers congress easy for the out party blame everything the party and argue that need balance the government but with split party control congress the balance arguably there already said the end says cook the fall elections may fought remarkably level playing field with the quality candidates and the amount campaign funding playing pivotal roles consequently both parties have been raising campaign money record levels the democratic senatorial campaign committee reported this week that raised record breaking million last year its republican counterpart the national republican congressional committee has not yet made public its total but raised million the first six months last year story can end here optional add follows despite the president popularity and the accompanying rise his party standing polls since sept show the public evenly divided party identification republican pollster bill mcinturff has cautioned that the economy bush soft underside another gop pollster frank luntz also cautions that the president and his party have until labor day demonstrate the soundness their fiscal policies what needs happen said perceived recovery the economy least two months before the elections still democrats have been emboldened the election democratic governors virginia and new jersey last fall replacing republicans both states right now you have democratic governors from mississippi the east coast new jersey said from the founder and director the democratic leadership council the promoter the moderate new democrat ideology anybody had predicted that two years ago they would have been laughed democratic strategists analyzing the virginia and new jersey races have concluded that their best approach the midterm election continue their steadfast support for the president his war terrorism but challenge him and his fellow republicans host domestic issues particularly the economy for example radio commercial sponsored the democratic congressional campaign committee last month against against rep john shimkus ill preview what likely come the charged that the administration backed economic stimulus package shimkus voted for congress last year was actually attempt pass billions dollars tax breaks for huge corporations shimkus responded with his own commercial since september america has united never before unfortunately that not always the case politics now not the time for partisanship bickering rather time pull together pursue justice abroad and repair our economy here home but partisanship what fuels elections and despite the unity over the war terrorism there sign that the tone washington has changed much from elections past democrats are accusing the

not come through the traditional route election appointment church hierarchy the pastor big miller grove baptist church assumed the title himself the lord laid heart become consecrated bishop explains when last looked the scriptures did not see where the lord said should called reverend fowler part curious transformation taking place outside mainstream churches increasing number pastors are giving themselves getting their colleagues the ministry for them status enhancing titles such bishop doctor even apostle the practice particularly popular the african american church some say been sparked the tremendous popularity bishop jakes pastor whose woman thou art loosed revivals and television ministry have made him famous not that many people called themselves bishop until jakes took the title says apostle jamie pleasant the kingdom builders christian center norcross once bishop jakes got everybody wanted bishop and like jakes shrewd businessman known for his marketing savvy these pastors believe that adopting catchy title sets them apart competitive field says riggins earl professor ethics and theology the interdenominational theological center atlanta who earned doctorate from vanderbilt university order compete reverend not enough for their status says even calling themselves doctors doesn enough have find other titles that have more mystical appeal the embracing popular titles raises some troubling questions though today common for public figures like college football coaches political candidates get caught lying about their qualifications ethical for pastors claim names such bishop doctor though they don meet the traditional qualifications that come with those titles that question touches struggle church leaders have had since jesus disciples were first recorded arguing over who was the greatest says alton pollard director the black church studies program emory university who earned doctorate from duke university are seeking the world validation the same time that struggling honored god pollard says tough balancing act freedom improvise this rush elevated religious titles goes deeper however than the success jakes scholars and preachers say some has with the changing demographics african american congregations african american churches are becoming more middle class and educated turn they expect their pastors share their level education with rapidly growing african american middle class there has been expressed need have the clergy feel they par with their membership pollard says yet members african american churches still rarely question pastors about their credentials the reason due tradition the past african american pastors sometimes assumed titles such doc bishop compensation for being denied access higher education and some within the african american community even with its growing middle class accept that tradition today pollard says many still believe white america fails give black ministers the respect they deserve thus some congregations are sympathetic pastors who may not have the credentials but still demonstrate leadership pollard says this person may not actually have the degrees the world says are important but bestow our own sense importance them says but the trend not confined african american churches spreading through churches that fall outside mainline congregations charismatic megachurches and independent congregations archbishop earl paulk for example the white pastor the cathedral the holy spirit decatur assumed his title through nontraditional means bishop from south america gave him the title said church spokeswoman outside mainline churches pastors also have more room improvise they often don have run for election earn advanced academic credentials assume new title like apostle jamie pleasant they can simply say that god gave them their title pleasant the pastor kingdom builders christian center norcross apostle has traditionally been viewed one the disciples who knew jesus during his earthly ministry paul converted shortly afterward yet pleasant who has marketing from georgia tech but seminary training says apostle literally means one who sent god points the apostle paul example who did not know jesus the flesh pleasant says that like paul was personally appointed jesus says jesus literally appeared him one day laid his hands him and said you are apostle pleasant says doesn feel need attend seminary gets confused about biblical translation uses computer software that translates greek and hebrew his church now has members says say this humbly have very high says doctor another title pastors have been assuming for years creflo dollar the pastor the second largest church metro atlanta world changers church international too was addressed pastor recently two years ago not anymore now calls himself creflo dollar dollar however has never graduated from seminary has bachelor degree education from the state university west georgia earned doctorate religion dollar new title said church spokeswoman comes from another source received honorary degree from oral roberts university henry mitchell atlanta author and one the country leading authorities african american church culture says the practice common mitchell who holds earned doctorates theology and divinity says there are many pastors who call themselves doctor after receiving honorary degree preachers even have nickname for the degrees there are lot donated dignity doctorates says everybody and their brother want have doctorate different definition the title bishop though the most coveted among this new breed pastors but what precisely bishop depends whom you ask mainstream churches bishops are elected appointed church hierarchy the idea person declaring himself herself bishop verges heresy you really implying that you becoming authority unto yourself says earl the interdenominational theological center you were the early church the bishop was appointed the whole thing was affirmed and recognized the community faith you don appoint yourself says yet there another definition bishop that becoming more popular the new breed bishops cite passages the new testament such those the first book timothy where pastor described bishop overseer they say the new testament doesn use the word reverend but bishop bishop eddie long pastor the largest church the metro area the best known converted bishop the area was consecrated bishop the full gospel baptist church fellowship relatively new movement within african american baptist churches that embraces pentecostal beliefs long pastor new birth missionary baptist church lithonia says calls himself bishop because the bible says bishops oversee other pastors well long says offers guidance least other pastors the bishop pastor pastor says someone who recognized for their ability cover other ministries some may ask what important about assuming the title reverend bishop but assuming the title bishop offers distinct advantage for pastor more power reverends traditionally have answer deacon boards other church groups bishops have more autonomy fowler says longer has answer board deacons who would hire and fire will not having any authority over other than the lord with and congregation have the power change whatever need change within the church without having get approved any other person fowler says hodges deacon fowler church says the change his pastor title meant little him don really look names and titles says they don have bearing look the service the man has rendered gospel story some outsiders may question why churches accept pastors changing titles some don churches split some cases members leave the christian tradition however ultimately teaches that those who seek worldly titles elevate themselves are betraying the example jesus earl says one the most famous passages the gospels earl says jesus washes the feet his disciples the night before his execution the foot washing function then performed slaves was used jesus introduce new style leadership was against those who have need lord over people with their titles earl says radically turned

could say this enough said john olson veteran energy industry analyst with the investment firm sanders morris harris given adrenaline driven culture given obsession with percent year better earnings growth you had this situation develop where enron was set metastasize rise and fall transforming itself then paying the price all started the heady takeover days the 1980s after his pipeline company

evident the company supporters wall street through enron chief financial officer andrew fastow the company set series limited partnerships organized such way that company executives reckoning they could treated separate entities was like magic financial elixir that provided the answers many enron growing problems there were any assets debts the books that the company did not want they could simply shed the partnerships but the partnerships were the poison that would finally the company undoing last fall enron stock was falling its auditors arthur andersen said that some the partnerships had treated part enron combining them with the company wiped out more than billion stockholders equity and contributed million third quarter loss wall street long complacent now was demanding answers about the partnerships the securities and exchange commission opened formal investigation and each time enron seemed have provided every answer new surprise popped out the markets for the company

company collapse slightly more than week later dec enron filed for bankruptcy protection its dreams greatness were over deregulation energy middleman changed market enron wasn merely the largest player the nation deregulated energy markets helped create them the trading natural gas and electricity used tightly regulated utilities built power plants under the guidance state officials and charged rates that allowed them recover their costs plus profit was monopoly system that promoted stability but also inefficiency the natural gas side interstate pipelines including those owned enron transported gas from producers utilities and other consumers set prices along fixed delivery routes but after oil prices collapsed the mid 1980s many users natural gas switched cheaper fuel oil and enron led lay helped convince federal regulators that pipelines would falter unless they were freed shop for customers and for the best deals from producers once the market began open gas prices began fluctuate wildly enron stepped with new products that allowed customers lock long term gas supplies stable prices with enron taking cut the 1990s the federal government was similarly speeding the deregulation wholesale electricity markets effort strongly backed enron and other energy companies new independent power producers were free build plants and sell power and ever growing amount electricity was traded among utilities unregulated power generators and power marketing companies enron moved aggressively seeking gain the biggest shares trading these new and fast growing markets

nation energy trading not producing much energy itself but serving mostly middleman more significantly enron dominated the trading financial contracts derivatives based the value gas and electricity traded physical hubs around the nation some hubs rival energy traders say enron accounted for much higher percentage trading some products giving enormous influence the marketplace the company dominance only increased after its introduction enrononline internet based trading service what remains point contention how enron used its power the company always maintained that took only small profits individual trades and instead made money packaging and arranging complex deals for customers but the wake its collapse many investors enron appeared more like giant energy hedge fund making bets energy prices last year california officials went further accusing enron and other power traders profiting manipulating prices there and driving electricity costs billions dollars late and early california deeply flawed deregulation scheme played large role the price spikes the state had not built major power plant decade but securities filings last year enron itself acknowledged that its enormous gains energy trading profits were partly result overall higher natural gas prices which had soared along with the price electricity gas important fuel used for generating power and price volatility the company critics observe that while energy prices were rising enron was riding high but that began falter this summer the same period when prices for electricity and gas collapsed other words they say may not coincidence that enron house cards tumbled down the same time energy costs sharply retreated profits from high prices were longer able offset severe problems the company the breakdown oversight missed signals and black hole flying high after being unshackled from regulation enron crashed quickly last fall following series revelations about its bookkeeping practices particular concealing huge chunks debt transferring them into still murky partnerships reducing the debt its books the company looked healthier and its profits looked more robust even the results its trading operations and energy sales were flagging stock analysts and shareholders could breathe easier could credit rating agencies like standard amp poor and moody investors service who assess company health for lenders but within matter weeks the company found itself bankruptcy under investigation and the target lawsuits from burned investors and former trading partners many questions remain unanswered but one thing certain result enron successful lobbying efforts washington was largely out the business regulating those products the company sold the regulators washington were asleep was because the company had made their beds and turned out the lights the company financial successes were small part the byproduct its political and regulatory campaigns deregulate the marketplace created what one executive last year referred regulatory black hole but there were still traditional corporate mechanisms and institutions place that should have raised alarms and kept executives check the fact that things declined fast strongly suggests breakdown basic corporate governance said david ruder former chairman the securities and exchange commission who teaches northwestern university school law auditors who had multiple and potentially conflicting roles did not raise alarms about improper financial statements directors did not closely question management and the accountants and thus failed ferret out the accounting irregularities lawyers set partnerships that concealed the true financial plight the company ratings agencies yielded the entreaties management and only reluctantly downgraded credit ratings and some wall street analysts like david fleischer goldman sachs continually recommended the stock even plummeted experts said the newness enron trading products and techniques might have ultimately confounded executives and auditors who were supposed supervise and watch the enterprise this appears board that like other companies that have gotten into trouble was composed people interested solidifying relationships rather than meaningful review and oversight said james cox authority corporate law and accounting duke university school law for all the blame now being assigned cox and other experts say the biggest failure least based what has become public far appears rest with the company auditors arthur andersen appeared that the accounting firm was reviewing financial product which they didn understand cox said while andersen executives have said that they were misled their client cox and other experts said that auditors have aggressive questioning management the job the auditors ask tough questions and not just blithely rely what they hear from the executives said joel seligman dean the washington university school law with the disclosure last week that andersen employees had destroyed large numbers documents related the firm audits enron investigators will aiming many their toughest questions the accountants the politics the bush connection and new questions beginning the early 1990s enron pursued its campaigns for energy deregulation hiring dozens washington most influential lobbyists and showering democrats and republicans capitol hill with large campaign contributions but enron and its chairman lay forged their deepest financial bonds with two presidents george bush and more recently

energy regulatory commission supplying bush chief personnel adviser with list preferred candidates and curtis hebert chairman the commission until last august said had unsettling conversation with lay last winter which lay offered him deal changed his views electricity deregulation enron would continue support him his job was offended hebert recalled lay said the time that had sway over hebert job

bankruptcy evans said lay had sought government help with its dire financial condition and friday the administration said that peter fisher undersecretary the treasury was contacted repeatedly last fall enron president greg whalley for help arranging bank loans ari fleischer the white house press secretary described the contacts with the two cabinet officers case where contributor called and

        "text": "anthony dixon simple man the center complex debate can barely read write tests has consistently scored below the accepted cutoff that determines who mentally retarded was living group home for the retarded when fatally shot houston dentist and was sent texas death row although dixon case will not issue when the supreme court hears arguments next month whether ban the execution mentally retarded killers the court ruling likely will have direct effect him and untold number other death row inmates around the country when the court last ruled the matter cited lack national consensus against execution the mentally retarded and allowed continue but many legal scholars now believe the high court poised reverse itself and declare the practice unconstitutional the speculation fueled the efforts the court made take the issue this session and comments justice sandra day connor recently made questioning the fairness capital punishment there are more than people death row nationwide texas and nobody knows for sure how many are mentally retarded the houston chronicle has attempted answer that question least for harris county which sends more people death row than any other place the united states the paper contacted more than attorneys who participated the cases the people currently death row from harris county the paper reviewed trial accounts and appellate briefs determine the cases that might affected supreme court decision the paper found least seven men including dixon who arguably fit the clinically accepted definition mental retardation there could more and the supreme court bans executions the mentally retarded other defendants undoubtedly will raise the issue their appeals the seven inmates identified the chronicle are men with tested iqs that fall least points below which considered average men who they worked all while free held the most menial jobs men who failed mainstream courses children and were educated special education classes they bothered stay school all many cases they are men whose ability reason right from wrong already hampered their low intelligence was hindered further childhood abuse they are men convicted killing shopkeepers women children the supreme court decides unconstitutional execute the mentally retarded these men likely would some the first use the decision grounds request reprieves such court ruling would not automatically spare these men the execution chamber appellate prosecutors would have the right challenge the validity the tests introduce evidence these men are perhaps more intelligent than they appear and argue that they managed function other aspects society despite their low scores the standardized tests the possibly affected cases identified the chronicle dixon perhaps the most clearly defined still contentious dixon was student boarding school for the mentally retarded nacogdoches when was arrested for the murder elizabeth peavy the time dixon was adult under texas law with criminal record that included six felony convictions peavy was year old dentist who spent her free time leading youth group her church and providing free dental care the poor neighborhood clinics she was the middle three children family close they still meet sunday evenings for dinner their parents home bellaire was one these family dinners that beth her family called her was heading the day she died peavy spent the morning like she did nearly every sunday attending services cuthbert episcopal church she ate lunch with friends and then headed visit her parents she stopped kwik stop small convenience store and gas station across bissonnet from sharpstown high school there she crossed paths with anthony dixon dixon was his way play basketball with two guys from the apartment complex where his mother lived trial the men said dixon asked them let him out the car when saw peavy filling her year old red ford thunderbird with gas his confession dixon told police wanted the car but went about stealing unusual way instead jumping behind the wheel and speeding off when peavy left the driver door open and went inside pay dixon sat the curb and waited for her return met her the car and when she screamed shot her four times then ran back bissonnet but his friends had sped off when the shooting started dixon ran after them before returning peavy shooting her twice more pulling her body out the front seat and speeding away was arrested days later the nacogdoches youth home despite his enrollment school for the mentally retarded harris county prosecutors went after death sentence they presented evidence that dixon was higher than the test scores provided the defense indicated they also told jurors that had street smarts that are not measured tests karen hudgens was the jury that decided dixon fate the jury she said considered the evidence about dixon retardation and rejected that itself was not enough hudgens said even child that raised around guns knows they can kill knows you don the peavy family position executing the mentally retarded clear think the mentally retarded know right from wrong that just basic tenet said kathy peavy bailey the dead woman sister there are lot mentally retarded people who would not out and shoot someone mental retardation can caused many things genetic birth defects birth trauma head injuries lack oxygen toxic chemical reactions anything that can damage the central nervous system can cause mental retardation said houston forensic psychologist jerome brown down syndrome the most widely recognized form mental retardation because its distinguishing physical characteristics but not the most common the texas department mental health and mental retardation estimates that about percent the state population mentally retarded the national average between percent and percent according the american association mental retardation the aamr and other groups opposed executing the mentally retarded contend the punishment cruel and unusual because the mentally retarded have more difficulty reasoning discerning right from wrong fully understanding the consequences their actions than more intelligent criminal defendants lot mentally retarded people may know something right from wrong but they don know why said brown who has examined criminals during his year career when you don have that thinking harder control yourself when impulses come something wrong the mentally retarded are less likely overcome troubled childhoods brown said and they are more susceptible suggestions making them more likely confess crimes they did not commit according the aamr these are just some the reasons that many legal scholars believe the supreme court poised declare unconstitutional the execution the mentally retarded when considers the virginia case daryl atkins atkins was convicted murdering year old airman after robbing him for beer money reportedly has the supreme court was split when decided the texas case johnny paul penry that executing the mentally retarded was constitutional penry texas most famous mentally retarded death row inmate penry who has scored between and tests was convicted raping and murdering pamela moseley carpenter the east texas town livingston connor wrote the majority opinion the penry case although the court decided that juries should allowed consider defendant mental capacity when considering punishment also declared that national consensus had not developed against executing the mentally retarded the time only maryland and georgia had laws prohibiting such executions today the states that have death penalty statutes and the federal government ban the execution the mentally retarded chronicle poll conducted the fall found that percent harris county residents oppose putting mentally impaired murderers death the texas legislature last year passed law prohibiting such executions but the bill was vetoed gov rick perry who wanted the decision left jurors the supreme court made point take the issue this session originally the high court was hear the appeal mentally retarded man from north carolina who murdered cafeteria worker the case became moot when north carolina banned the execution the mentally retarded and the court agreed hear the atkins case its place further fueling the speculation among legal scholars are recent comments connor last summer while speaking attorneys minneapolis she questioned the fairness the death penalty and said statistics are any indication the system may well allowing some innocent defendants executed south texas college law professor neil mccabe said many believe the year old jurist has changed her mind the issue think she going retire soon she looking back what she done and not feeling all that good about she wants fix this one mccabe said she the vote would take she probably the swing vote possible the court will merely clarify its position executing the mentally retarded nothing more than reaffirm its previous position four justices can decide take case for the court but takes majority the nine members make ruling richard dieter executive director the death penalty information center said unlikely minority the court would take case knowing they would lose they going make statement one way another dieter said seems they want change some way among those eager see what the justices will are demetrius simms and the family year old monique miller simms was convicted murdering monique near north houston apartment complex simms was tried four times for the crime because the first three juries could not agree verdict simms scored test administered the time his arrest his competency was issue all four his trials this guy clearly retarded said defense attorney mike stone going execute year olds then that what this all about simms had lengthy criminal history that included conviction for the sexual assault year old boy chuck rosenthal now the harris county district attorney said was the criminal history that compelled him prosecute simms four times felt very strongly that demetrius simms did not get the death penalty that within years after preyed upon monique miller would out preying little girls again rosenthal said under current texas law people given life sentence for capital murder must serve least years before they are eligible for parole least five other local death penalty cases could touched the court ruling exzavier stevenson suffers from both low intelligence and mental illness stevenson was convicted shooting two convenience store clerks death february stevenson scored test and was enrolled special education classes child janet morrow appellate attorney said stevenson also was abused child and was taught his family fight doesn roaming the streets looking hurt people she said even though his reaction the convenience store was inappropriate was appropriate the way was trained react one the issues being raised theodore goynes appeal goynes was convicted kidnapping raping and murdering linda tucker her 25th birthday goynes also has lengthy criminal history that involved two other vicious sexual assaults goynes scores tests have ranged from his attorney michael charlton said goynes also suffered horrific abuse ruby tucker the victim mother law was one many who urged perry veto the ban executing the mentally retarded last year have friends who have and believe they are not retarded she said there are some felons out there who could fool god didn have all seeing eye they know how play the justice system like fiddle darrell carr was sent death row for the murder year old priscilla rangel rangel seven months pregnant was visiting her boyfriend the convenience store where worked when carr and friend robbed the place during the robbery carr shot rangel four tests administered from the time carr was years old until was carr scored three 68s and psychologist also said there are indications carr psychotic anthony pierce death row for the aug murder fast food restaurant manager fred johnson pierce scored and respectively three tests took teen ager failed every class junior high school michael richard was convicted breaking into and robbing the hockley home marguerite dixon and murdering her during richard first trial defense attorneys told the jury richard had scored that conviction was overturned and new set defense attorneys did not mention his second trial contacted recently the attorneys said they could not remember why les ribnik who representing richard his federal appeals was unaware richard had scored low test and this point has not raised appeal but ribnik said would the supreme court banned the execution the mentally retarded the law changes then could raise for the first time said marguerite dixon murder reiterates that the debate not limited courtrooms and legislatures can divide families too celeste dixon was when her mother was murdered now dixon opposed the death penalty and supports ban executing the mentally retarded somebody mentally retarded don think they can aware the full consequences their crime she said how can someone who has very limited mental capacity aware fully comprehend the consequences the crime don think the death penalty should apply that case but dixon one seven children one other joins her opposition the

        "text": "eighty eight players the draft were plucked before terrell owens including receivers keyshawn johnson terry glenn eric moulds marvin harrison and amani toomer relatively speaking owens was ignored and terrell eldorado owens certainly does not like being ignored the san francisco 49ers made him their third round pick and pushed this wired receiver into their starting lineup started games the most 49er rookie receiver since gene washington started times years earlier and his third season the playoffs against the green bay packers owens made that spectacular winning yard touchdown catch with seconds left that insured would never overlooked again since then owens has done plenty remain noticed there was the incident texas stadium last season where ran not once but twice the cowboys star painted the middle the field and celebrated score there was the 49ers overtime loss chicago this season when owens said his coach steve mariucci did not play win because mariucci close friendship with the bears coach dick jauron owens also remained visible making more spectacular touchdown receptions more flashy big plays and more dominant games from player who good and productive any receiver the league today owens helps give the 49ers wealth attitude and confidence that will needed sunday frigid green bay when the packers and 49ers scrap the playoffs owens has the moxie and the mouth the speed and the hands the will and the competitive fire figuratively snatch opponents the throat and overwhelm them only the 49ers completely understood that said even after made that catch against green bay didn really feel like the next year that the torch was passed from jerry rice receiver owens said now eventually became big part our offense then and now but don think the guy right now when jerry was age was catching and balls game here had moments like that but last week against new orleans for example caught two balls both were for touchdowns and yards the 49ers victory not griping about this speaking facts said you don know what you have player when the light going click feed till tired and even then going make something happen there doubting that the sixth year player from alexander city ala earned his second consecutive pro bowl selection after having another yard receiving season and leading the league touchdown grabs with says the emotional components his game are bluntness and pure honesty they are selfishness and immaturity his critics say thinks himself country boy make that southern boy said with smile and revealed that innately reserved and moody others consider him hog for the spotlight player who can never get enough exposure actually owens has granted few interviews since the blowup chicago oct his locker near the middle the 49ers dressing room that where owens robust receiver who imposing feet inches and pounds sat for few minutes before boarding the team bus for the ride the airport route green bay explaining few things starting with the texas stadium fiasco when ran the first time the star was just being creative and having fun owens said there was the star below and the opening the roof above intentions were not bad ones but then after emmitt smith did after dallas scored felt had back second time after scored the second time did out spite but didn expect create such stir guess never live that down nope steve and john mcvay and bill walsh from our front office called the office after got back owens said they said was being suspended for week for conduct detrimental the team they felt was such disgrace but didn was like the worst thing that could have happened around here went home alabama for the week frustrated and confused over the matter missed game was fined but eventually got back settlement his relationship with mariucci and some his teammates changed you could feel the tension everybody was looking with raised eyebrows owens said not the same with steve now and probably never will but will not let impact working toward our team oriented goals and after that and the chicago thing this year just decided try not anything all controversial since knowing everything knows now owens was asked would all the same way yes would owens said maybe too honest brutally honest not politically correct guy didn anything try embarrass hurt anyone just tried honest others and myself and that something not going change never been problem guy never had problems with coach until now the remarkable thing about owens that though tangled adversity and controversy continues improve player the tougher the challenge the more excels teammate who requested anonymity said some guys here have just put with terrell others consider him friend and others just stay away from him but there way that anybody here doesn respect the way works and what means winning football games were politician were even team captain would trouble great football player just terrell and can back anything says that good enough for owens stays superior condition using strict diet and tough training regime and out season none the receivers drafted before him with the exception marvin harrison are his caliber said owens played basketball tennessee chattanooga division team and has doubt that could have excelled that sport pro too competition fuels him publicity satisfies him made catches league single game record against chicago has developed into solid blocker and his longest receptions have been and with career total touchdowns his six game playoff totals are catches yards and touchdowns also has rushing touchdown and point conversion his career but can catch more said score more more signed through the season but said option could end his contract after the season will owens 49er for his entire career the chips will fall said wherever they fall has begun learn and employ the nuances playing his position listen him describe one his touchdown grabs last week against the saints was coming across the middle they had scouted well and they were sitting there the middle took off the post deep jeff garcia and have been working things like that breaking off routes and making things work and has the mobility and arm quarterback make work came wide open and free there was reason just the middle and run into the defense reason for cover myself the field seems off"

everything from mysterious gamma ray bursts deep space revealing images penetrating the turbulent heart the milky way earth home galaxy two new discoveries described the meeting underscored the growing and bewildering realization that planetary systems abound the nearby universe and that they come all shapes and sizes bearing little apparent resemblance the sun family planets both discoveries revealed unexpected configurations stars and orbiting companions observations telescopes hawaii astronomers were surprised detect object that ordinary planet orbiting sunlike star light years from earth the object brown dwarf the name given what are thought failed stars that lacked the mass ignite their nuclear furnaces michael liu astronomer the university hawaii reported that the brown dwarf was estimated have mass about times great that jupiter the solar system largest planet the brown dwarf orbiting the star called sge distance billion miles times the distance between earth and the sun and more than twice close any previously detected stellar companion that more massive than ordinary planets the more than giant objects that have recently been found orbiting nearby stars most have been estimated jupiter size planets but several are massive that they are suspected having starlike origins and thus being brown dwarfs this companion probably too massive have formed the way believe that planets namely from circumstellar disk gas and dust when the star was young liu said this finding suggests that diversity processes act populate the outer regions other solar systems other astronomers said the brown dwarf discovery was important because was the first these extrasolar companion objects detected direct observations not indirectly measuring the effects their gravity the motions the host stars new technology called adaptive optics spinoff military research uses computers compensate for atmospheric distortions and produce sharper images faint cosmic objects alan boss astrophysicist the carnegie institution washington and theorist who specializes the new planetary systems said such discoveries were really just tantalizing appetizers for things come report related discovery astronomers said they had detected for the first time planet orbiting extremely large star one that had already burned its hydrogen fuel and was dying the star iota draconis has expanded radius that times great that the sun which average size star until now was not known planets existed around such giant stars said sabine frink the university california san diego member the discovery team this provides the first evidence that planets earth like distances can survive the evolution their host star into giant sometimes coming down earth astronomers speak almost ordinary language when they talked the meeting about cosmic bubbles fountains and halos the bubbles are this case ghostly cavities huge galactic clusters the clusters more galaxies stretch millions light years across and are considered the largest stable objects the universe from the centers the clusters cavities virtually devoid ray and radio emissions rise like bubbles glass soda pop some bubbles are large light years wide almost big the milky way brian mcnamara astronomer ohio university athens described the discovery and analysis the bubbles with data from the chandra ray observatory earth orbit the bubbles mcnamara said were most likely created extremely powerful explosions probably involving material plunging toward grasping black holes observations show that the bubbles are not completely empty but contain some hot gas high energy particles and magnetic fields the bubbles may play major role transporting magnetic fields through the clusters think magnetism some locations the universe could have been important gravity shaping the galaxies and even larger scale cosmic structures ncnamara said edward murphy astronomer the university virginia reported other spacecraft observations that have yielded evidence for towering fountain gas nearby galaxy ngc which telescopes bears resemblance whale the spacecraft the far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer fuse operated for nasa the johns hopkins university describing the phenomenon news conference murphy managed use all three evocative terms bubbles and halos well fountains did that proposing possible solution the longstanding mystery the ultimate fate energy from exploding stars supernovas profusion stellar explosions murphy suggested would probably start the circulation hot gas rising fountain bubbles out the galaxy and into the halo diffuse cooler gas that surrounds the galaxy gas remaining the halo for perhaps million years would presumably cool and fall back into the galaxy bringing with material for the next generation new stars murphy said the fuse data provided the first good evidence for the long theorized galactic fountain cycle circulating gas some the same ultraviolet observations have enabled astronomers detect clouds hydrogen gas raining onto the milky way galaxy and glowing contact with the intergalactic medium like showers meteors that streak through earth upper atmosphere from the fuse data the astronomers found that beyond the previously known and denser halo around the milky way there was another one less dense and hot possibly one million degrees fahrenheit that outer halo invisible ordinary light can see ultraviolet light blue football shape envelope around the entire galaxy astronomers said the outer halo could left over from the formation the milky way may have been created early episodes star formation which the hot gas was heaved supernovas and expelled from the galactic disk perhaps some kind fountain bubbles any event because astronomers are still detecting the hydrogen clouds that are falling into the galaxy they think the milky way still pulling new material the new findings said kenneth sembach the space telescope science institute baltimore are going

multimillion dollar verdicts against deep pocketed manufacturers the suits are unfair because companies stopped using lead paint for homes and furniture long ago sherwin williams case largely the 1930s long before the federal ban these companies essentially voluntarily took their product off the market long before the federal government acted norton the interior secretary said her confirmation hearing last year but activists and trial lawyers point documents showing that far back century ago paint companies knew lead was dangerous while european countries were banning the 1920s the lead

women several their stories are told detail ponton recent book the sex lives teen agers plume therapist ponton hears more negatives than positives these stories depict the dark side teen agers experiences still they provide window the landscape that teen agers navigate interview she discussed risks that teen agers face and how parents can help american teen agers don have the highest rate sexual activity the world but they have the riskiest sexual behavior your book says what risks are they taking study kaiser family foundation compared american teen agers teen agers from germany france england and holland found that american teen agers have the highest rates teen pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases our teen agers have times the rate hiv infection teen agers france rape and violent sex are also higher the teen population our country terms involvement relationships think there increased frequency casual sex among teen agers this country don have very good studies but from clinical reports there strong indication that three quarters teens said recent survey that oral sex not sex they don realize that they can contract hiv and other sexually transmitted diseases from oral sex why are american teen agers such risk takers our sex education poor for one thing you look the other four countries they have far better sex education middle school and high school may have one hour for every that they get addition states now accept abstinence only money from the federal government from just before that means that get government funding for sex education schools those states are under pressure teach students that abstinence the only way avoid pregnancy and percent public schools districts teach abstinence only there talk about birth control preventing sexually transmitted diseases very limited that really quieting sexual education this country there strong evidence that these programs don discourage teen agers from becoming sexual active half those over age are sexually active disturbing finding the national youth risk behavior survey last year that one five high school girls has been physically sexually abused her boyfriend other words she has been physically hurt forced have intercourse against her will why this happening culture where violence layered over everything violent and sexual themes run through the media many the sexual and violent images the internet and other media use girls objectified sadistic ways very hard for parents and teen agers talk about sex itself but then talk about sex and violence combined becomes particularly difficult boys say that they want masculine that they want the boy role but they concerned that that means taking advantage girls often the girls work with who are violent relationships think that they can change the boy they think that they nice the boy will modify his behavior with our limited sex education neither boys nor girls have opportunity discuss these gender roles and how they play out dating how gender roles fuel teen age sexual violence while gender roles are changing dramatically the workplace they being enforced more rigidly the schoolyard seen the emergence fem girls and macho boys these traditional gender roles are strong the middle schools and high schools the media reinforces these roles britney spears emblem she needs provocative and much sexual object she can but she promotes herself virgin girls are encouraged adopt passive gender role they don have the skills deal with violence their relationships see boys who are addicted sex sites the internet that show sadistic behavior toward women affects those boys sexual lives and also what see with our daughters there also political factor believe that response the liberal period the 1970s and 80s returned the double standard the 1950s your book says that early developing teen agers are especially vulnerable high risk sexual behavior can you talk about their experiences studies indicate that the early developers are risk that not surprising because they really treated sexual objects believe that early developing girls are vulnerable having sexual activity before they ready and then feeling that they not good people then they define themselves sluts prostitutes early developing boys are vulnerable too had boy practice who was feet and had the physique year old but was only sat office and played with legos women and older teen ager girls would come him sexually kept saying what these women want didn understand that they wanted sexual activity wasn ready couldn even talk girls look them the eye talked about the fact that that wasn ready what can parent with early developing child help let take girls first emphasize how healthy and normal her body but also talk candidly with her about one daughters was early developer and can recall going the mall with her and watching boys and men reactions her body suggested strategies and comebacks that she could use one example only say your age that one the best comebacks most guys will back away think important give kids practice and role play list comebacks for the situations they find themselves boys too have practice how deal with women who expect things from them and how admit that they have not had sexual activity that something don talk about with our boys how say never done this and not sure want same sex schools have enjoyed increased popularity recent years because many parents think there less sex stereotyping there than coeducational schools what the reality below eighth grade there are some nice studies academics showing that single sex schools are beneficial girls but there are studies showing less risk taking among students single sex schools ideally all schools should make effort reduce sexual harassment and stereotyping what can parents protect their sons and daughters from sexual violence think you have emphasize with your kid that first off relationship important keep yourself safe emphasize this before dating starts but also you see cycle violence developing sexual and emotional abuse kind tightly woven relationship where there often cycle that parents can perceive even when you see hard believe one close friends child psychiatrist his daughter was killed dating violence parent would look for escalated angry language the boy shouting hang phone calls

snuffed drilling holes and pumping inert gases foams that stifle flames others have been flooded damming surface streams and creating lakes over the burning coal some fires have been controlled excavating deep trenches that cut off the fires the same way fire break woodland can stop forest fire from spreading but most cases the costs such efforts outweigh the benefits that was why centralia

laptop computers and while after that lawn mowers scooters and perhaps vacuum cleaners but not cars least not soon cars the industry view are down the line said peter hoffman editor and publisher the hydrogen and fuel cell letter among the problems practical technology for storing hydrogen the quantities needed for vehicle has yet invented the carmakers hope for metal that can absorb hydrogen and later release when heated but for now they are working with tanks which hydrogen stored pressures pounds per square inch level seldom seen consumer products and the technology for attaching the hydrogen metal for storage were perfected the infrastructure for distributing and retailing liquid hydrogen does not exist that formidable challenge the people who tried sell much simpler alternative vehicle fuel fuel natural gas discovered their sorrow the 1990s natural gas cars require hardly any new technology and natural gas lines reach tens millions homes and businesses but extending them filling stations proved impractical and natural gas has cost advantage over gasoline perhaps the biggest problem for fuel cells that for now least they cost roughly times more for the same amount power than internal combustion engines hoffman the author tomorrow energy hydrogen fuel cells and the prospects for cleaner planet mit press said that since mobile fuel cells are not now commercially available their price not clear but that estimates range from and per kilowatt capacity car needs about kilowatts which implies propulsion system costing the cost could come down somewhat the body were made something besides ordinary steel and aluminum cars today are but that too requires new inventions general motors which eager produce fuel cells executives say that they may not have make fuel cells cheap plain old gasoline engines since fuel cell car would earn its keep higher fuel economy and would not need expensive components like catalytic converter transmission electric motors not require them but they would still have cut costs least percent they say ford and daimlerchrysler conjunction with ballard power systems inc fuel cell manufacturer vancouver british columbia have built prototypes and invested heavily bringing costs down ballard says has supplied fuel cells honda hyundai nissan and volkswagen well researchers have made great progress making the cells small enough for automotive use but they still have long way costs manhattan scientifics inc fuel cell company that preparing several products for commercialization said believes customers will fact pay per kilowatt but only for cells that generate only about watt and thus cost about that would enough for cell phones laptop computers not cars the company chief operating officer jack harrod said also hoped sell units for lawnmowers and scooters but not until the price was below kilowatt thought might need get down but ordinary gasoline engines cars produce the equivalent kilowatt for industry experts say fuel cells for homes may easier choice experts say since even middle sized suburban home with central air conditioning uses only kilowatts peak making the cost disadvantage per kilowatt less problem there also storage problem the house has natural gas from which hydrogen can easily extracted and house uses energy hours day which would maximize the benefits efficiency and low pollution most cars contrast are the road only two hours day for car executives justify the cost fuel cells whatever that turns out they are considering branching into entirely new areas christopher borroni bird director design and technology fusion general motors suggested using fuel cell equipped cars generate electric current when they are parked and plugging them deliver power the electricity grid car manufacturers are optimistic that they can eventually drive the price way down although unlike the old partnership the new one has timetable even specific goals according jennie sweet the council for automotive research the private sector side the partnership and also not complete break with the old program the old partnership included fuel cell research and the new one will continue research diesel electric hybrids another problem for the new partnership the all nothing nature fuel cell vehicle while the old partnership never produced the mile per gallon sedan did advance some

engaged high powered nationwide lobbying campaign dissuade elected officials from suing them the paint lobbyists working from city halls the white house say they are trying counter aggressive lawyers bent enlisting governments such lawsuits have different message than what the plaintiffs side would and think public policy makers should informed when they make decisions about litigation said former maine attorney general andrew ketterer now lobbyist for several paint manufacturers including sherwin williams the nation largest the lobbyists say that because most their clients voluntarily took lead based paint off the market decades ago governments should leave them alone and instead after landlords who let painted walls deteriorate and peel but some public officials health advocates and trial lawyers say the lobbying campaign scope expense and high profile players reflect the paint companies steely determination duck responsibility the last year cleveland based sherwin williams lobbying team has included former rep alan wheat former rep martin russo ill former republican governor pennsylvania and attorney general dick thornburgh and maine ketterer interior secretary gale norton lobbied for houston based paint maker industries inc before president bush tapped her for his cabinet the companies goal stop the spread lawsuits cities counties and housing agencies all with

breathe paint dust can cause brain damage mental retardation and extreme cases death taxpayers are now paying for the health care many children and the removal lead paint from housing particularly older urban neighborhoods each year thousands children are diagnosed with lead poisoning the lawsuits that have been filed involve complex state laws and some have been dismissed without the plaintiffs winning penny but relatively new suits milwaukee louis san francisco and several california counties have refueled paint industry critics including some elected officials the state rhode island hopes its pending suit will lead the way for states recoup money they have spent dealing with lead paint problems just the past month some communities new jersey have filed suits against sherwin williams cleveland based glidden and others officials chicago and west virginia have said they too might sue and the paint makers are taking their case city councils county commissioners and statehouses using not only their national teams but also local lobbyists hired each locale san francisco last year they were pretty aggressive far trying get hold any litigation said ingrid evans

paint lobbyists message lawmakers this lawsuits will fail and won help single child clean single building they are being pushed shrewd trial lawyers who think they get share multimillion dollar verdicts against deep pocketed manufacturers the suits are unfair because companies stopped using lead paint for homes and furniture long ago sherwin williams case largely the 1930s long before the federal ban these companies essentially voluntarily took their product off the market long before the federal government acted norton the interior secretary said her confirmation hearing last year but activists and trial lawyers point documents showing that far back century ago paint companies knew lead was dangerous while european countries were banning the 1920s the lead industries association was devising ways for manufacturers downplay the danger and keep selling the paint thus groups like wisconsin citizen action and the healthy children organizing project san francisco see the lobbying sinister light and say the paint companies are delaying obfuscating and refusing accept responsibility their rationale said michael amato milwaukee alderman who sponsored his city resolution sue that much cheaper kill here than litigate later that measure almost paid off the milwaukee resolution which amato says would have sailed near unanimous approval there had been lobbying passed only one vote

plaintiffs lawyer jack mcconnell glad surprised them there question about that said the rhode island based litigator whose firm was instrumental the tobacco litigation the 1990s now top lawyer representing cities against paint makers and again and again and again can mcconnell said because the companies are evil nasty force that will pull punches try and bring down the pressure try and stop

jack coburn racer who disdains city slickers and who turns out ted father snow dogs also stars nichelle nichols sisqo graham greene and whole parcel siberian huskies the two have reunited talk about the film and their casual bantering gooding hotel suite any indication the year old gooding and the year old coburn have missed each other company the two best supporting actor winners gooding for jerry maguire and coburn for affliction trade quips they lounge side side sofa coburn finally suggests that spot chopin would order and off the two the hotel bar before they departed however got question two about acting filming blizzards and course those dogs any merit fields warning against acting with kids animals coburn was more accurate about kids they were such beautiful animals didn have any problems with them did gooding nope nope they were doll they were professional they were well trained coburn and they did everything required them without whimper generally with big bark and whoom let they love run man they were beautiful gooding only gripe was when would finally get scene right then they have maybe another take for dog maybe not hitting his mark that kind stuff dogs get used the repetitiveness and after awhile they get bored and start doing their own thing but brian levant the director helped because shot quick soon got the master shot above the dogs heads and the close ups real quick coburn they bark and holler and soon someone said phew was nothing but the snow and the sled was great feeling gooding the back that sled coburn was great fun people asked wasn hard wasn hard all you need hang you can understand how people get hung doing gooding got little cold times like with the blizzards and coburn was trouper you were trouper with that stuff because was like there way getting the back that sled and got take after take doing coburn got nosebleed one night had the blizzard and couldn finish scene started producer jordan kerner got panicky thought was really falling pieces said jordan going five minutes mon let get the scene and insisted going down miles the doctor she said was just little nose bleed there doesn seem anything there and said that what told you jordan blew the whole expletive night because this nose bleed and your anxiety laughs gooding when you outside the cold and something below zero the moisture your nostrils the hair freezes feels like you breathing rocks the weirdest thing some cold nights there but just beautiful rocks your nose mark missing bow wows sounds like blast what attracted you two snow dogs begin with coburn attracted because was playing son and thought that would interesting thing laughs the script fascinated and doing disney film you have learn whole new kind form work within because there are parameters you can beyond like swearing cussing the actions have within certain form that was kind challenge for was for you gooding absolutely also have new kids ages and there whole part life now when home not working film over weekends want try bond with them quickly possible like many parents all across america take kids family movie the problem with that the movie either too geared toward kids where boring too adult oriented and kids are bored with this script was such nice balance there the dogs and everything and the action the keaton esque physical comedy riding the dogsled but the same time the relationship the dynamics james coburn and character didn play big racial thing was just coburn finding father gooding finding father and thought that was the smartest thing had read because the face america changing man coburn must say had great time working together was really joy gooding also close these characters very sweet man even though plays really hard the beginning the movie was character with some the stuff were doing not couldn differentiate because was always open done other films with actors who have played these dark roles and they have stay character all day and that how they get that place that wonderful but hard tell had such good time the character and real life coburn you don have take that with you learned long time ago where acting acting and real life real life sometime crosses over but you can the same person doing both but carry that expletive around with you man just sick you don have that gooding like stress same thing you doing some brooding character and you feel like you see these great dark performances you meet the guy and still character and you think man you got let laughs you need bottle wine something coburn affliction for instance that was pretty dark character before did the scenes sitting around sissy spacek and nick nolte and would sitting around telling jokes and stories and just carrying when was time bang into that thing change you could just turn especially when you got script paul schrader gooding someday you have work with him because his scripts are clear and concise you just read them and you know exactly what gooding realize the importance being the same wavelength director you guys aren clicking man return the recommendation coburn says you should work with paul schrader then should work with gooding coburn have you ever worked with james brooks brilliant and his mind constantly going cameron crowe another one like that these two guys they were joy work with another guy would fun but haven worked with long wolfgang peterson but you worked with some heavy guys coburn they all dead laughs still around and they gone and left man peckinpah course and john sturges sam think was favorite with

engaged high powered nationwide lobbying campaign dissuade elected officials from suing them the paint lobbyists working from city halls the white house say they are trying counter aggressive lawyers bent enlisting governments such lawsuits have different message than what the plaintiffs side would and think public policy makers should informed when they make decisions about litigation said former maine attorney general andrew ketterer now lobbyist for several paint manufacturers including sherwin williams the nation largest the lobbyists say that because most their clients voluntarily took lead based paint off the market decades ago governments should leave them alone and instead after landlords who let painted walls deteriorate and peel but some public officials health advocates and trial lawyers say the lobbying campaign scope expense and high profile players reflect the paint companies steely determination duck responsibility the last year cleveland based sherwin williams lobbying team has included former rep alan wheat former rep martin russo ill former republican governor pennsylvania and attorney general dick thornburgh and maine ketterer interior secretary gale norton lobbied for houston based paint maker industries inc before president bush tapped her for his cabinet the companies goal stop the spread lawsuits cities counties and housing agencies all with

lobbyists message lawmakers this lawsuits will fail and won help single child clean single building they are being pushed shrewd trial lawyers who think they get share multimillion dollar verdicts against deep pocketed manufacturers the suits are unfair because companies stopped using lead paint for homes and furniture long ago sherwin williams case largely the 1930s long before the federal ban these companies essentially voluntarily took their product off the market long before the federal government acted norton the interior secretary said her confirmation hearing last year but activists and trial lawyers point documents showing that far back century ago paint companies knew lead was dangerous while european countries were banning the 1920s the lead industries association was devising ways for manufacturers downplay the danger and keep selling the paint thus groups like wisconsin citizen action and the healthy children organizing project san francisco see the lobbying sinister light and say the paint companies are delaying obfuscating and refusing accept responsibility their rationale said michael amato milwaukee alderman who sponsored his city resolution sue that much cheaper kill here than litigate later that measure almost paid off the milwaukee resolution which amato says would have sailed near unanimous approval there had been lobbying passed only one vote the

the answer that has changed for the good over the past decade today three south korean automakers have dealer networks hyundai kia and daewoo and among them they sell everything from econoboxes sport utilities minivan and near luxury midsize sedans the short answer that for the most part the korean autos get here are pretty good they aren quite japanese standards but they are least good not better than their and european built direct competitors when the korean cars began arrive here they were cheap knockoffs japanese cars way below japanese standards but eagerly accepted consumers who initially thought that they would good japanese cars because they came from that side the globe those first ones from hyundai gave the company black eye that still trying recover from but the south koreans credit they have significantly improved their vehicles point where they can compete effectively against japanese and european competitors make for any deficiencies the vehicles might have quality and durability they generally are offered bargain prices comparison japanese and even cars that certainly the case with the all new kia sedona minivan kia which entered the market with two vehicles the sportage compact sport utility and the sephia compact sedan this past fall became the first the south korean carmakers introduce minivan the united states because financial problems mostly involving its parent company kia motors was sold hyundai but will remain separate company for now with its separate sales and marketing arm the sedona was already the works when hyundai bought kia and development the vehicle was allowed continue even though hyundai still has minivan its lineup these very well equipped minivans start just for the base model and for the uplevel version with fully equipped topping out about comparison chevrolet venture ranges from about the honda odyssey from and the industry leading dodge caravan from just under more than found the kia quite comparable japanese models such the odyssey and mazda mpv but not quite the caliber the best japanese minivan the toyota sienna yet for the price the sedona quite bargain inch for inch the fit finish and attention detail clearly cut above the dodge and chrysler minivans but the overall range options and features somewhat limited when compared with the dodge chrysler vans and those from ford and general motors for one thing kia doesn offer electric sliding doors feature pioneered general motors the early 90s the oldsmobile silhouette and later copied chrysler and others its credit though the sedona has sliding doors both sides the rear passenger compartment that almost close themselves just release the door from its catch and let and weighted slides forward and latches with help long the vehicle level ground pointing downhill maybe that better than having electric door that can catch little fingers even with safety mechanisms that are supposed prevent that outside the sedona looks like just about every other minivan the market and particularly similar the ford windstar and toyota sienna that surprise the koreans have had qualms about copying others designs for their cars and learned the 90s that really doesn pay get truly creative with minivan design anyway called dustbuster minivans the early 90s the chevy lumina apv previous generation silhouette and pontiac trans sport were generally eschewed consumers because their cutting edge design inside the kia quite well appointed least the version the dash and instrument panel are trimmed wood grain something that would come only more expensive version the competing minivans controls are easy reach and simple operate and the gauges are big round analog style instruments that are easy read even low light our car came with two quite comfy front bucket seats two captains chairs the middle row and bench seat the rear for total seven seating positions even with the rear seat place there was decent sized cargo area the rear cubic feet thanks the sedona long wheelbase inches for the base caravan under the hood quite adequate liter horsepower engine which has more horsepower than the caravan and more than the venture the

point apparently not completely closed the door ajar light came intermittently along with the interior overhead light and couldn get open again from the inside outside could close properly while later

into debt however they speak one voice the new testament advises readers owe man anything and polonius famously said hamlet neither borrower nor lender should people fail heed these admonitions they often they risk both their morality and their independence becoming slave the lender franklin said paraphrasing proverbs when entire societies ignore the warnings they forfeit future prosperity for conspicuous consumption this the essence the most widespread worry about the american economy today after having taken ever higher levels credit card and mortgage debt finance arguably the highest material standard living the world has ever known americans will eventually have cut back many economists and writers have argued the economy will suffer for years people save more and spend less recent months however growing group economists have begun challenge these conventional worries them americans spending habits threaten the nation economic fabric more today than they threatened the moral fabric ben franklin time debt natural part economic life these economists say and its level not high when compared the population wealth this view has won new followers academia and wall street over the last year which brought precisely the kinds events that might spook people about their finances but despite recession the worst terrorist attacks the country history and war undetermined length consumers have continued increase their spending levels although modestly spate research has helped the argument well chiefly putting current debt and savings levels the context wealth rather than income prodded alan greenspan two economists the federal reserve recently discovered that the much discussed decline the personal savings rate the 1990s occurred almost exclusively among the richest percent americans who also registered large gains stock holdings and home values another economist jonathan skinner dartmouth likes show people chart that plots people net worth assets minus debts relative their income the graph suggests that group americans worse off than they were decade ago once their homes mutual funds and retirement accounts are taken into account households with the median income were worth about twice their annual salary slightly from and handful wall street economists picking other research from the fed have begun arguing that the decline the official savings rate from percent years ago roughly zero now more accounting fiction than actual trend last year lehman brothers tweaked the worriers titling one report are households saving too much one section was called forget ben franklin the stock market collapses then you have real problem for the consumer but doesn collapse then forget about the low savings rate ethan harris senior economist lehman brothers said not issue this soothing argument has received helping hand from another discipline too lendol calder cultural historian augustana college rock island ill published financing the american dream princeton university press calder said had set out trace the troublesome history consumer debt but had ended finding much more concern about debt than harm caused addition the bible and ben franklin warnings came across headlines like never have many owed much news amp world report and debt threatens democracy harper fact said debt main role has been allowing people buy items they could otherwise not afford the upshot was book which tried debunk what called the myth lost economic virtue the mistaken notion that previous generations had wisely practiced frugality while the current one was spending its way toward trouble don need alarmed chicken littles running around saying the sky falling the sky falling calder said the sky hasn ever fallen course debt really larger part the economy today than was the past people pay for everything from groceries college tuition with their credit cards banks have used risk management computer programs expand the portion the population which they are willing issue credit the number americans owning home and therefore having mortgage and the size the average mortgage have both soared even the anti chicken little crowd acknowledges that some point debt can become unmanageable for society there limit calder said but don know what that limit the idea that the current debt level poses few any risks remains minority view many economists americans are already overextended from household liabilities more than doubled from trillion trillion according economy com research firm west chester despite the rise unemployment people have continued take out new loans the last year thanks largely low interest rates and interest free auto loans payments those debts will come due matter what even the stock market collapses home values and incomes fail rise people making less money are especially vulnerable because single problem like layoff enron like collapse retirement savings can cause them fall badly behind mortgage and credit card bills soon debt stops increasing its recent rapid pace the more pessimistic economists say the brisk economic growth the late 90s will impossible some sense what drives economy forward willingness extend credit and willingness take debt said james galbraith economist the university texas but one needs distinguish between general aversion debt and the issue whether the pace that debt being accumulated can sustained view that debt the point that households are likely retrench for substantial period time galbraith said voicing concern many economists the optimists response begins with the government official savings rate measures the amount every dollar income that people put away instead spending and has fallen from almost percent the early 80s percent decade ago and about zero now but the figure excludes gains assets like land and stocks which have been plentiful recent years the same time subtracts the taxes people pay such gains from their income effectively lowering their savings rate person buys stock for sells for and pays tax her gain she appears the government accounts have lowered her savings when she has actually raised far she concerned the increased popularity plans instead pensions and the decline the number companies paying dividends their shareholders also skews the savings data harris lehman brothers said the research that has gotten the most attention was done dean maki and michael palumbo who were both economists the fed when greenspan suggested they combine two data sets break down the savings rate income group they concluded that the rate fell sharply the 90s for the percent americans with the largest salaries fell slightly for the next fifth but did not fall for the rest the explanation they said the long bull market which allowed affluent people increase their spending dipping into their stock portfolios the wealth effect the story behind the decline the savings rate maki said there are valid methodological reasons for the commerce department tabulate the data the way does economists say but one result that the savings rate makes households balance sheets look worse than they are the steep drop the personal savings rate over the last decade has fueled speculation that americans are spending recklessly report the federal reserve bank new york concluded year ago these fears are not well founded with joblessness likely continue rising the coming year will provide good test recessions have way resolving debates like this one"

obstacle the extent indebtedness said max sawicky economist the economics policy institute that makes for some doubt about the strength consumption spending the nation economic woes officially recession that began march has already cost more than million full time jobs and torched corporate profits and approaching the month duration the average recession anticipation rebound intense optimists including most wall street economists and mainstream forecasters predict turnaround this year they see growth the third and fourth quarters annual rate about percent others talk about something more languid expect moderate recovery said maury harris chief economist ubs warburg recovery imminent but that still leaves plenty room for debate the precise speed and strength the turnaround how they consumers perform will strongly influence how quickly growth revives this year much wall street had begun buy the notion quick reversal and investors began shoving stocks skyward but harris and others cautioned the premature enthusiasm the sell off began yet mainstream expectations still call for bring recovery rebound and return growth the optimists cite low inflation which permits the federal reserve keep interest rates low they point the low price oil for cars and heating kind rebate for the economy that clips company costs and puts cash consumers pockets and consumers who have already done much keep this recession from being far worse business spending went from hesitant nearly nonexistent spending continued from the two thirds the economy that consists consumers that can again some people think hope sure seems there one else take the role washington waffles corporate earnings wane and there been convincing rally stock prices can the american impulse spend aided tax cuts make the difference that question divides economists there simply consensus about what factors will fuel recovery perhaps because the downturn itself like other entering typical recession consumer spending drops dramatically purchases cars houses and appliances are postponed under the threat reality layoffs but when things improve spending booms pent demand bursts not this time said mark vitner economist for wachovia securities this recession has been very odd from the get the current recession did not start with higher prices and interest rates triggered consumer overspending instead business blew out its checkbooks pouring money into new equipment new plants and huge retail developments fueled spectacular stock prices and floods venture capital companies reached for the stars expanding far beyond demand for what they sold many internet companies fell from grace then came manufacturing the core the economy collapse that continues march the economy was recession destiny sealed sept all year long the federal reserve campaigned for more spending eleven times the fed cut short term interest rates down year lows make borrowing cheaper unfortunately for many companies new investment remains stalled they just added too much capacity during the boom now manufacturing plants are producing percent rate capacity clear sign that companies don see demand catching yet which why consumers figure into positive projections after all they have already done much while company investment plunged the economy rose the updraft consumer spending sales homes stayed strong refinancing mortgages poured hundreds billions dollars into the economy and thanks zero interest financing vehicle sales hit records the fall most recessions end when the pent demand consumers unleashed spending spree this time consumers get credit for keeping the economy out recession for months and while the recession technically dated from march was the sept shock consumers and their abrupt spending halt that pitched the economy into the ditch and even then consumer spending has kept the downturn relatively mild but that means housing and vehicle sales are already strong they cannot expected explode said gary tapp quantitative analyst for suntrust robinson humphrey the slingshot rebound from consumers that you usually get after recession probably will not happen this time still consumers count lot consumers could surprise the experts and brighten the picture they could turn sour and keep any recovery anemic worse yet the most recent numbers are hopeful the monthly university michigan consumer confidence survey came month high most the increase came the strength consumer expectations that the economy will stronger within few months there are reasons hope for the best tapp said relatively low mortgage rates might prop the housing and construction industries and indicators last week seemed show hope for strength and the huge tax cut passed last spring could serve throw roughly billion into the hands consumers this year this year lowered tax brackets seem nearly minuscule the average household will benefit only every two weeks yet that paltry sum will

will mailed annual tax refunds the next few months that money too likely spent and will act stimulus said but skeptics scoff rising unemployment one strike against consumer spending kind feedback loop

the current jobless rate currently percent will likely crest over percent economists have said rajeev dhawan director the georgia state university economic forecasting center has predicted the rate

friendly fire and course the enemy and many the military were surprised how much they had accomplished even the war entered new phase with the first use american ground troops late october senior commanders were unsure that sending few dozen advisers into the fight could topple the taliban and cripple qaida they were ready throw much larger numbers conventional troops into combat the ground campaign opened one the darkest nights the war four days past new moon and when the sun rose the next morning oct two very different operations had been completed illustrate the choice methods that the pentagon was considering but the pentagon the time spoke publicly about only one the operations that occurred that night just hours after the mission ended the pentagon announced that hundreds army rangers had parachuted onto military airfield about miles south kandahar while helicopter raid hit taliban compound the edge the city dramatic videotape the airborne assault was broadcast but the pentagon said nothing for several days about secret ground war which quickly became the real ground war that started simultaneously the north the first two teams army special forces the division known the green berets infiltrate afghanistan landed helicopter that same night according special forces commanders who planned the mission one joined with abdul rashid dostum the war calloused northern alliance commander near mazar sharif and the other with muhammad fahim khan now afghan defense minister whose forces were then loosely arrayed against the taliban the direction kabul more would follow but was not easy during just the second mission carry special forces teams into the north the helicopters were unable land because powerful sandstorm cannot even begin describe the frustrations senior commander recalled were right there was like just six more inches but couldn get over the goal line but just three weeks those teams the special forces calls the detachments dozen select troops transformed the northern alliance into force capable routing the taliban army which was increasingly damaged and demoralized the more precise bombing that the american target spotters made possible few things surprised the pentagon and its commanders much how rapidly the military picture changed with the arrival the special forces the prospect fighting big battles with american troops faded away brig gen richard comer deputy commander the air force special operations command hurlburt field fla said the more conventional plan had been put large amount american forces hop them air the

operations forces encompasses the unconventional warriors all branches the military while special forces had trained with some central asian militaries they had never worked with afghans whose

giving our teams the field much more than they gotten before the past there was lot information that was not given captains and the teams this time they got the first question was whom help and took weeks answer basically had figure out who was bad bad guy who was bad good guy and there were any good good guys the officer said the north they chose from commanders who had kept their armies intact after the taliban gained control the cities the south they looked for tribal leaders who could attract fighters their side from the mainly pashtun tribal groups one such leader was karzai who infiltrated afghanistan from pakistan believed had the most loyal following but they weren soldiers said special forces lieutenant colonel named dave who commands the teams that linked with karzai outside kandahar providing security and military advice his forces they were shopkeepers and farmers and friends said dave who like many the unconventional warriors spoke condition that his last name withheld they would advance the front toyota pickup trucks and subaru taxis getting uniforms ammunition and food those forces took time but with american advisers their sides they took the offensive quickly and with the special forces designating the targets the front lines the intense bombardment from the sky gave the anti taliban forces the ultimate advantage air operations calling airstrikes

the guys the ground were originally conceived developing classic liaison relationships with local forces with the goal being build groundswell opposition senior military officer said said this strategic plan became more tactical the special forces teams proved effective spotting targets for american bombers and attack jets refocused our efforts the officer said did not expect they would

stronger when the employer matching contributions are automatically directed company stock even while the stock price declined enron chairman ken lay told employees was vastly undervalued and urged them buy more experts agree that there are good reasons why companies match employee contributions with stock rather than cash starting with the fact that costs less company matching stock that

odometers one might have wondered why given the region slippery winters these rear drive wagons were popular among the highly educated one reason was their reliability and another was that the cars had fairly good traction the snow despite their rear drive design partly because the wagons particular had some weight over the rear wheels and partly because volvos didn have lot wheel spinning power back then and the cars boxy practical designs affirmed their owners serious mien and their aversion fads lot about volvo has changed recent years the company incorporated front wheel drive for improved traction and space efficiency and spruced its styling and image the swedish company now member the ford motor premier automotive group along with prestigious names like aston martin jaguar and land rover the volvo product range has expanded include the s40 and v40 compacts the s80 luxury sedan the v70 and cross country wagons and the c70 luxury coupe and convertible the big volvo news this winter the xc90 sport utility which made its debut this month the detroit auto show plus the arrival model the company first all wheel drive sedan the s60 awd the awd uses horsepower version volvo liter cylinder engine other s60s come with horsepower has five speed automatic transmission that lets the driver shift gears manually nudging the shifter although you can get front drive s60 for little the awd base price test car sticker read all wheel drive least all wheel drive option quickly becoming badge honor the near luxury class having grown accustomed suvs consumers are reluctant give the safety and security four driving wheels and word has spread about the capable performance even dry roads all wheel drive audis and subarus for the s60 volvo chose not borrow the all wheel drive system from the cross country wagon but uses new unit created haldex sweden mechanical pump and wet multi plate clutch were added the s60 basic front drive platform distribute power the rear wheels electronic control senses when the front wheels are starting slip and forces oil into the clutch that connects the rear wheels volvo says this power sharing happens quickly that the driver senses nothing and experience that true such system weighs less and less complex and has little affect fuel economy the s60 attractively styled with the sort flowing roofline you expect coupe viewed from the rear the car wide stance gives capable stable appearance the good first impression enhanced the obvious quality the way the doors were made and how they fit well the materials and finish the interior the trunk also well finished the hinges are designed not impinge the space contrast the luggage squashing designs many domestic sedans the instrument panel also has high quality look incorporating clear sensible gauges and easy use climate control system this system has separate temperature controls for the driver and front passenger and also outlets the center pillars that direct air toward rear passengers the audio system takes some getting used and although applaud the lack push buttons found that the knobs that select the the radio stations and control the operating mode took eyes off the road for longer than like one would expect any volvo have array safety features and the s60 does the force the front air bags varies depending the severity crash the car distinctive body construction said offer extra protection side impacts along with the side air bags and inflatable curtain that when deployed covers the front and side windows also all the safety belts have pretensioners hold occupants tight crash and the front seat head restraints are designed guard against whiplash one new feature for the driver can press button the dashboard flip down the rear head restraints one seated the back eliminating potential blind spot the government attests the effectiveness several these safety features front test crash mph the driver and passenger positions each rated four stars out five the side crash test both front and rear seating positions received five stars the road the s60 ride was smooth and steady previous volvos built the front drive platform have had rather harsh jarring ride that wasn keeping with the european road car image that volvo would like cultivate found the ride smoother over most road surfaces than the audi the steering response and handling while bit less crisp than the audi were very good indeed the anti lock brakes which also have emergency brake assist feature apply maximum force panic stops were smooth and progressive typical volvo the front seats are large and very comfortable with wide range adjustments though would have liked more lower back support because the coupelike styling the rear seats are rather low giving occupants sitting hole sensation but the s60 european competitors not have generous rear seats either interior noise has lot with feeling comfort and was surprised the s60 low noise level the highway quieter ear than the for example the low pressure turbo gave smooth and quite powerful performance and noticed turbo lag the engine response the engine and transmission worked well together with seamless shifts and plenty acceleration when needed shift torque the rear wheels were imperceptible the government gives the s60 awd mileage rating town and the highway averaged mpg premium gasoline recommended for best performance but octane all that required according the owner manual the s60 competitors this class with all wheel drive are the audi the bmw series the jaguar and the mercedes class all are state the art european sports sedans and all are excellent performers advice try them all they may all have equivalent features but their personalities are different"

coming out over the course coming weeks and months what form bad with enron that hard say but managed numbers are pervasive think you going see lot restatements earnings least how and why did corporate accounting get this bad your opinion think the competitive juices that fueled much growth economy have caused number companies stretch closer and closer the line meet analysts expectations and some cases going over the line our economy competitive that companies and and won far behind the regulatory environment and legislative environment simply has not been able keep why couldn you why didn you more chairman the sec did focused this issue more than any commission history called attention had major war with the accountants they turned congress and congress really hamstrung efforts try and bring some semblance change into the way those watchdogs should have been watching the numbers you think congress looking these problems differently today congress concerned about its own image the midst all this they leaning over backwards responsive the public outrage that exists today will that play out terms the types legislation that think necessary skeptical why this very technical stuff and the people who would not like see happen are more powerful than the people who would and have given more money what all this mean the individual investor think the premium for

balance sheet partnerships that precipitated the company collapse last fall but bilardello said they involved the debt problem that had never been resolved the early 1990s bilardello said amp would regularly add billion obligations and debt enron when doing their risk calculations huge amount compared other energy counterparts that figure was grow with time became more comfortable with their international strategy which included earning money building the power plants earning money from selling their output and later selling them off bilardello said but put one the lowest investment grade ratings enron and had kept that rating for more than years dropping margins enron trading business matured through the mid and late 90s and its revenues grew rapidly another troublesome trend began said arthur smith chairman and ceo the energy research firm john herold inc beginning measurement cash flow known earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda started shrink percentage the company overall revenue ebitda was percent enron revenue fell percent then percent recovered few points percent and percent and respectively but was down percent drop those margins either means you stagnant declining business which was not the case you have high cost doing business smith said appears their growth had them building expenses such rapid pace which really warning sign jim chanos president kynikos associates new york hedge fund started shorting enron stock betting that would fall november got interested after accounting professionals began questioning the way energy traders recorded some profits chanos research found that lot enron insiders were selling shares parts its financial reports were indecipherable and the company had very low rate return capital the peak their reputation for innovation this was company earning percent its capital said noting that innovators with supposedly great market position should generate threes times that amount people who looked the financials carefully were sort underwhelmed egan who downgraded enron debt rating june said found the trading operations lot less profitable than expected because those operations were falling short egan believes enron began setting its controversial partnerships signs bigger problems many those early warning signs now appear indicators what many insiders say was unique enron culture relentless pressure close deals quickly even poorly structured when the deals were closed say former executives and analysts hefty bonuses were awarded based their projected value not the real revenues brought the company the deal was projected bring percent return investment the day you signed the deal your bonus would based that said carol freedenthal principal with houston based jofree energy consulting and longtime enron watcher but when the deal came maturity and the return investment really turned out something closer percent loss there was something wrong one former enron vice president who asked remain unnamed said deals were often restructured find some way make them profitable managers did whatever took close the deals and get their bonuses even required bailing wire and chewing gum the former said enron executives may have also closed deals quickly possible for accounting reasons enron and the entire trading industry uses method called mark market accounting which essentially requires companies report front the entire value long term deal that means company would book revenue the full value year deal for electricity revenue the quarter that the contract was signed but the books are supposed adjusted the value electricity changes over time enron pays more for power than projected when the deal was signed the change has recorded loss those the industry say this isn deceptive when done correctly though critics don like the practice saying can misrepresent company current financial position several current and former enron executives say that one division the company enron energy services should have reported steep trading losses under mark market accounting rules but they say enron shifted those losses another division allowing ees appear profitable bad its core more details enron finances trickle out some now believe the complicated off balance sheet partnerships that brought wave negative press last fall were used hide postpone losses from the better established and presumably profitable business units some are starting suspect that even enron trading business was not the mature bread and butter earnings machine appeared robert mccullough portland ore based analyst who did work for the california attorney general office during that state energy crisis said there are indications that enron had artificially inflated long term electricity rates allowing report higher earnings mccullough notes that when enron filed for bankruptcy early december long term power prices dropped percent matter days that exactly what you expect they had been managing those prices mccullough said and when enron accepted the bid ubs warburg take over its energy trading business out bankruptcy this month many were surprised involved front cash makes you wonder that business was all they said was that was the best offer they could get said freedenthal were creditor want see some cash today they had new ideas wall street for the most part appears have accepted enron spin over the years for number reasons including the company masterly self promotion the lucrative investment banking fees generated its many deals and its reputation for bullying those who dared questioned frankly said meade they told good story they were confident they were dynamic was exciting company listen they had new ideas think lot analysts and investors were captivated that but many including analysts and executives other energy companies still contend that enron will leave legacy innovation that changed the way natural gas and electricity are bought and sold was leader creating financial products that insured energy sellers and users against the risk falling rising prices also was the first aggressively sell utilities and other large commercial and industrial customers the means saving money outsourcing energy needs what they accomplished being factor and influence the gas and power markets that wasn smoke and mirrors said senior executive another houston energy company the executive though noted that enron influence the energy markets was far greater the past when was first out the gate that has been confirmed the speed with which other companies quickly stepped after enron collapsed absorb much its business takes time develop markets said egan the corporate credit rating agency enron wasn the party over the long run"

about flying not about flying itself that but about terrorism though she continues board plane once twice month her job executive large pharmaceutical company she will fly only certain airlines avoids traveling new york when possible and thinks twice about taking cross country flight plane carrying large fuel load she and her husband have discussed whether they want receive the call farewell message from hijacked airplane she does doesn and for least the next year she said she will not allow her three sons ages and take commercial aircraft for business something got nolan said but are driving key west from chicago for spring break with the passage time and the advent new security measures americans are gradually being coaxed back into the skies the air transport association reported this month that domestic passenger traffic was down percent december from the same time last year compared with percent november and almost percent immediately after the hijacked planes crashed into the world trade center the pentagon and field pennsylvania yet for most americans deciding travel air has become far more complicated and anxiety laced process everyone much more aware their mortality all sudden said michael liebowitz director anxiety disorders clinic the new york state psychiatric institute and professor clinical psychiatry columbia university everyone doing the calculus differently many like nolan have made adjustments the way they travel setting rules they hope will offer some protection one survey major airlines and their customers mercer management consulting global aviation division for example percent those polled said they had altered their travel patterns because fears about terrorism and percent said they had stopped flying altogether out fear another survey found that leisure travelers who indicated that the events sept continued influence their travel plans percent said they believed was not safe fly one those donnie colvin division manager voice and data telecommunications firm louisville who the moment would sooner bungee jump than take airplane lifelong phobic flyer would literally cry the whole way said conquered his fear last year completing course offered soar inc connecticut based company buoyed what had learned colvin flew tampa fla with his wife sept for vacation the trip was successful was looking forward the return flight sept then turned television sept that was the end flying days said colvin who rented car and drove the hours back louisville colvin who said not only would not fly himself but would not let his wife tracie fly texas next month has classic aerophobia the fear flying called suffers from panic attacks and like others who have specific phobias fear snakes heights for example aware that his anxiety excessive but not everyone who has stopped flying since sept was skittish begin with the images that day broadcast repeatedly still linger vividly many people minds that kind learning goes deeply into the psyche said capt tom bunn retired commercial pilot and the founder soar and for every person who has forsworn the less friendly skies there are many more who like nolan will board planes some situations but not others the particulars such strategies differ from person person some passengers fly only their favorite airlines some avoid certain cities some couples like nolan and her husband will not let their children fly others will fly only with their children rick marchman corrections officer atlanta said was unwilling fly new york visit his wife during the three months she has been working there because there was much going but planning flight fort myers fla with his family sometime this spring don feel that terrorists are going florida said mental health experts say that making such distinctions may give people greater sense control over uncertain dangers joyce slochower professor psychology hunter college and visiting professor new york university postdoctoral program psychotherapy and psychoanalysis noted that the face unexpected disaster loss people often made internal bargains trying create encapsulated arenas protection support the illusion safety but the end she said the distinctions carved out nervous flyers are different from the approach one her patients who now avoids the subway but willingly drives over bridges the interesting thing about slochower said that variant the illusion all use every time get and leave our house say our husband our kids see you tonight even though brick could hit bus could run over such behavior irrational maybe call justifiably irrational said jerilyn ross the president the anxiety disorders association america rationally you think about flying still the safest means travel but wouldn say the fears are irrational because something horrible happened other words even now the odds ending plane with bomb hijacker are much smaller than the chances being killed automobile accident but statistical risk while comforting the mind does not always persuade the gut indeed the extent that mental disorder defined deviance from societal norms the very fact that anxiety about flying widespread has made the fear more socially acceptable and thus less aberrant before you looked silly you didn fly and everybody was embarrassed about liebowitz said now there much more social support for because many people were affected this new acceptance reflected the tolerance many companies now show toward employees who express qualms about flying who wish limit their travel specific airlines destinations what seen since sept that companies first and foremost want their employees safe said marianne mcinerney the executive director the national business travelers association adding that percent the more than companies that form the association membership had offered counseling educational materials employees who expressed concerns about air travel most businesses she said have been more than happy allow traveler delay trip until they felt ready survey conducted november yesawich pepperdine amp brown percent business travelers who cited concerns about terrorism said they would prefer drive rather than fly when possible fifty six percent reported that they would take fewer international trips percent said they would not travel new york and percent that they would not travel washington two months later those numbers have most likely declined and least some companies interviews with employees suggest patience for those who refuse fly altogether beginning wear thin but experts agree that likely take while for the public fear subside know from many studies over the decades that when you get these populationwide traumas there always temporary pulling back said david barlow professor psychology and director the center for anxiety and related disorders boston university still and others added avoidance feared situation only makes the fear worse the most difficult thing seems getting the plane liebowitz said but once you and nothing terrible happens you can again unreasonable fear that lasts six months more and interferes with daily life barlow said meets the criteria established the american psychiatric association for diagnosis phobia problem that can successfully treated with variety therapies which help people regulate their emotions gradually desensitize themselves what they fear and challenge distortions their thinking that nourish their anxiety people fear flying still keeping them the ground next spring even though they realize that with the added security flying safer than ever barlow said then you begin say maybe this something they should begin doing something about"

the drain many the trees that were salvageable would have been quickly logged but this land the environmentally savvy the management the publicly owned forests under microscope the biological toll that logging can take landscape well known toll that especially harsh forest hit hard high intensity fires its struggle cut and sell trees burned the enormous fires the summer the forest service finds itself trying convince environmentalists that careful logging not only benign but critical the forests recovery and protection the service which responsible for both forest health and selling timber has proposed salvaging million board feet ponderosa pine and other trees more than three times much would normally sold the area the service says the plan which involves more than blackened acres will create thousands jobs and raise money used help replant trees and repair stream beds environmentalists however are not buying the notion that the forest must logged save least not the scale the forest service proposes they challenged the sale procedural issue and early january federal judge agreed and stopped the project jan the forest service said would appeal and asked the judge allow five emergency sales ahead one the most controversial parts the recovery plan for the burned area may the potential for damage the soil forest service officials say any damage will minimized restrictions that allow logging only frozen and snow covered ground and using techniques like helicopter and skyline logging that keeps heavy equipment and dragged logs from disturbing soil but ken mcbride forest soils scientist with the forest service who has studied soil conditions the bitterroot national forest since argues that those protections don far enough and that the logging could cause lasting damage seen logging wrong too many times said mcbride who did not work the recovery plan for the service and opposing private citizen disturbance from logging compacts soil and scrapes away natural sources recovery said among them the seeds pine grass huckleberry and beargrass the organic layer gone and the soils lose their ability grow plants said natural recovery after fire especially such dry environment slow healing process said and add additional damage not smart thing logging can interfere with natural recovery other ways while some timber companies argue that leaving burned trees waste biologists say the trees play critical role the death the burned trees occurs progressively over year period says wayne minshall professor ecology idaho state university who has studied the effects fire western streams and landscapes for years they are like time release capsule begin optional trim while standing they provide cover for elk and deer when pine bark beetles and other insects swarm feed the dead trees woodpeckers and flickers follow and the charred trees provide home for these cavity nesters even burned trees help keep the forest floor cool hold soil place and reduce evaporation neither are fallen trees finished with their ecological responsibilities for they coddle life returns the forest once the logs come down there whole other suite species that use them said jack ward thomas the former chief the forest service and now professor wildlife conservation the university montana fallen trees act natural dams stop erosion steep slopes and can make nutrient rich soil they decay end optional trim dead trees also play important role stream ecosystems they stabilize soil and protect stream banks minshall said they provide shade and cover the streams keeping them cool enough help fish survive when warm nature says minshall takes care its own eventually streams are adapted physical disturbance like floods and fires said but added effects stream can devastating the first couple years ash burned trees and mud create charcoal slurry that once reaches stream can kill fish and scour out and widen streams factor times after this pulse burned material has been flushed out the ecosystem however the stream starts recover with the forest canopy gone places sunlight causes algae grow which feeds insects nutrients like nitrogen and potassium freed from vegetation the fire stimulate the growth willows and other riparian vegetation which improves insect populations and the size and number fish some logging minshall said could done where fires have occurred but under careful prescription preserve the time release effect you log you have keep the appropriate mix trees said and not just cut the trees that are biggest and most valuable forest service scientists not dispute the idea that burned trees play important role the recovery ecosystem but they argue that allowing nature reclaim itself this particular burned landscape could lead serious damage part because errant management policies the past more than century fire suppression has led unnaturally high levels fuel most forests even though trees were killed damaged the recent fire there remains potential for new kind threat they fall the ground when they burn they cause excessive heating soils effect sterilizing said mick harrington fire ecologist with the forest service fire research center missoula the forest here said evolved with frequent low intensity fires just pine needles the fire out four five minutes said you have logs the fires burns for hours and hours such hot fires impair the forest chance for natural recovery the life that lies waiting under the soil moreover leaving such high fuel loads the mountains above the valley some fire experts say could set the stage for disaster when the next big fire season hits forest fires get extremely hot they create severe weather said brown the fires spill out the mountains and are funneled through the canyons and into the low elevations high speed said something called the venturi effect fire propelled could impossible stop before hits the valley where many homes and towns are located the winds generated high intensity fires also create phenomena called vortex streets eddies that are like little tornadoes that carry embers many miles away from the fire start fires elsewhere story can end here optional material follows another forest service plan for the bitterroot preventive the service has planned thousands acres thinning removal fuels prevent new fires low lying areas which are densely populated they claim fire suppression has led many trees growing per acre rather than trees per acre when the fire regime more natural environmentalists say far too much timber being cut under the guise thinning contention backed recent research based study several wildfires including the cerro grande fire los alamos forest service research scientist jack cohen agrees that the agency overreaching with its thinning proposal what determines house burning the condition the house and its immediate surroundings cohen said there still tendency want thinning the wild land zone not possible and not necessary either"

there nothing new the tough lessons learned thousands others during the past year when longtime employees were jettisoned like many gold watches after corporate waters grew rough this day and age there such thing security says william simon another contract technology worker simon survived years and four reorganizations exxon before taking severance package and going contract seven years ago since then worked four companies don feel any more risk than badged permanent employee says temporary workers have been around for decades traditionally filling for vacationing secretaries beefing assembly line meet production deadline the infusion professionals such friday and simon people such fields information technology advertising engineering medicine and law boomed the 1980s and early 90s more employers used short term staffing cut costs gain greater flexibility the growth leveled off the stock market skyrocketed and companies expanded now with layoffs shrinking the number permanent positions and job insecurity rising the number temporary workers again expected grow for employers the benefits are clear more worker bees without the paperwork and expense payroll taxes workers compensation and things don work out severance packages for workers mixed bag they have freedom and flexibility and the base pay occasionally better but they have fewer fringe benefits and job security they not always treated well excluded from holiday parties and forced attend company meetings and safety fairs even they not allowed keep any the goodies given away entice people attend are expected give much not more the company permanent employees one contractor says are expected put longer hours more productive and accomplish more than employee all the slim possibility there might permanent position down the line surveys show that more than half temporary workers would prefer permanent job with benefits and after proving themselves temporary positions many are hired fill permanent slots when that happens someone else steps into the temporary job pipeline some are there after losing permanent position others like friday consider contract work smart career move contractor work lot harder than did when was permanent person because continually try ensure that providing something value clients friday says when was permanent person that wasn really focus but temporary can more state mind than actual measure longevity temporary job can last anywhere from one day years says sue burnett whose burnett personnel services has about workers the job hundreds companies any given time she once had someone temporary position for years before was offered full time job with the company simon who works for burnett staffing company has worked hard the seven years since left exxon have steady contract work the only time haven worked when didn want says finished huge contract year and half ago and took five weeks off complete master degree that accomplished called burnett and within week had job mostly the year old simon says his contract paycheck has been about what would have been permanent slot once was paid less once substantially more for employers hiring temps often more about convenience and flexibility than about money contract workers provide safety net for employers says steve werner associate professor management the university houston they are way reduce the shock waves fluctuating economy because times are really good you can just bring some them and not have lot demands put the organization long term says when times are bad they the first let without lot severance pay the downside notes that probably not the best interest the employees temporary workers are less likely receive the same vacation and sick pay benefits that permanent workers receive says cathy ruckelshaus litigation director for the national employment law project new york they are also less likely have health insurance according federal government figures percent temporary workers have health insurance compared with percent people with permanent jobs only one fifth temps get their insurance through employer generally staffing agency that provides temporary workers number companies while more than half permanent workers have employer provided health insurance blame money for the gap most staffing companies offer group health insurance but few pay any the premium that leaves workers paying full freight hundreds dollars month more contract employees who don through staffing company are totally their own more broadly ruckelshaus says there also sense inequity temporary workers are the same workplace permanent workers the longer the called temp workers are there and the more there are them there just feeling not being fair they sometimes even expected menial chores clean the office kitchen fetch coffee for the boss that have nothing with their job descriptions says one contract worker point out that not job

oil company service department about five years ago she enrolled program for dislocated workers only told the obvious they said not like used where you could with company for years know that any time things may change jones who her early 40s worked retail sales before signing with several staffing companies since she has worked solely for the connection group buying health vision and dental insurance through the agency you kind know when you working temp one the agencies may not have something for you and you just check with the others she says you the agency doesn hear from you and know you available they figure you already working don need work she worked steadily but then she made the effort like going different places meeting different people she says you just have know always keep time sheet with you always get signed any day could your last day you kind the mercy the client but like ___ sometimes seems temporary workers are taking over the work force but even under the broadest measures used the bureau labor statistics fewer than percent workers are classified temporary contract employees figure that has held steady since the bureau began tracking according staff economist sharon cohany that includes free lance workers consultants and independent contractors who said they expected their current employment end within year well people working for staffing agencies which provide temporary workers virtually every field much for the myth that permanent employment fast disappearing cohany suspects the myth has several origins for one thing the temporary staffing industry did grow tremendously between the early 1980s and the mid 1990s when the bureau began its surveys that growth was fueled part demand more companies hired temporary workers give them flexibility matters such layoffs firing benefits severance packages tight economy temporary workers have also become more visible"

director leon ichaso sensed that pinero was gradually being forgotten and was determined stop that from happening went bit mission because saw miguel pinero falling through the cracks says the cuban born ichaso you couldn find his books you couldn find his movies even though his body work not that huge this life that should known that could all change with the release ichaso low budget impressionistic biography called simply pinero starring benjamin bratt formerly law and order with performance being touted for oscar consideration pinero died years ago cirrhosis the liver brought drug and alcohol abuse got the way his own success with life crime and never stopped says ichaso his substance dependence don think could imagine pinero step program meeting saying name mikey pinero and dope fiend there lesson learned from pinero life says the director that let the drugs get the way his talent stylistically ichaso kept his film raw and jumpy effort echo pinero writing style tried preserve that artistic chaos throughout his life explains keep disorderly possible get know the man the artist and see life through his eyes much possible think that lot times films are too glossy and too slick and don allow get into the story ichaso who also wrote the movie screenplay has been making films for more than years including the spanish language love story bitter sugar set against the politics contemporary cuba the gritty harlem drug drama sugar hill featuring wesley snipes and recent biographies rocker jimi hendrix boxer pacifist muhammad ali and san francisco assassin dan white they were all outsiders says the latter subjects much more interested people like that agrees that most directors might not think bratt play pinero since the performer more famous for dating julia roberts than for his acting skill but they would they saw him follow home directed bratt brother peter when watched had glimpse benjamin bratt who was not the boyfriend and nor the pretty boy detective curtis from law and order says played mural artist from east used prosthetic teeth shaved his head had his body all tattooed definitely gave glimpse where could film that interests him and began meet with him and talk with him and realized that was fearless says ichaso there were other actors considered for pinero and benjamin was the only one that wasn afraid the subject rather than having sell bratt taking the role which would clearly boost the film marketability ichaso says that was bratt who pitched hard land the assignment even though the first thing said when met was know not your man but maybe that was his reverse psychology make him more attractive bratt far from pinero possible from the west coast incredibly healthy man athlete surfer never used drugs his life says ichaso yet bratt immersed himself completely the role was like mikey took over ichaso already had the film financing secured the time bratt signed thanks small company called greenestreet films think they felt that was risk but that also had commercial potential the director comments very low budget movie shot for million days and got assemble pretty good cast with that addition bratt pinero features rita moreno mandy patinkin robert klein and giancarlo esposito actors who knew the playwright new york public theatre asked there was anything could not afford the tight budget ichaso does not hesitate more time would have rather worked with rita moreno week instead two days but sometimes that also gives urgency the storytelling that you can actually see the screen later his hope for the film says ichaso last recognized the critics and the people and discovered just like discovered pinero and became interested enough making the movie and that could perhaps open some doors for all referring hispanic artists establishing career filmmaker has been continual struggle for ichaso director future always tied the last film has made unless you are part the club then you can make mistakes and they still give you more money for the next one the reactions pinero have been extreme far that just fine with ichaso that type film says cannot expect you sit theater watching some the scenes with needles sex whatever and just smile and say like this the construction the script and the film itself very difficult for some people who are used more conventional biographical linear

what about this one telemann overture suite minor those are the titles two new works the new york city ballet has been offering during its winter season the new york state theater quartet verdi neatly made but uncompelling piece peter martins telemann the promising choreographic debut melissa barak member the company however what worth considering here not the artistic quality those ballets but their titles and what those titles reveal both about the new york city ballet and about much recent american choreography for ballet and modern dance alike american dance obsessed with even tyrannized music course dance and music have been partners for ages and deserve continue their pas deux yet fundamentally dance does not need music dance needs rhythm and rhythms can established the regular irregular ways bodies move space even without vocal instrumental accompaniment thus some choreographers have created effective dances silence sound effects most choreographers though like music and not hard understand why music sounds good can intensify mood atmosphere and its formal sonic patterns can suggest movement patterns nevertheless dance not subdivision music but independent art and dance works are more than music appreciation lessons much american dance addiction music can traced the influence george balanchine great choreographer who was musically sensitive extraordinary degree and who titled many but means all his ballets after the scores which they were set even renamed some productions honor their music thus his ballet imperial has since been known tchaikovsky piano concerto and palais cristal created became symphony year later until his death continued naming ballets after scores among his works being danced this season new york city ballet are divertimento duo concertant kammermusik stravinsky violin concerto and tchaikovsky suite other choreographers for the company have sometimes followed his example quartet and telemann demonstrate and ballet and modern dance groups around the country often choose similar musical titles for works there nothing necessarily wrong with this practice choreographers should have the freedom call dances anything they choose just abstract painters have been known give canvases with slashing lines and vibrant colors such noncommittal titles may yet this proliferation musically titled dances makes fear that many choreographers may limiting their inspiration music alone balanchine once termed music floor for dancing image implying that dances are like houses but houses have features other than floors for instance they have windows and doors which the outside world can let out too other factors than music can influence dance indeed aspiring choreographers might find valuable study painting and sculpture gain sense volume shape and grouping literature and mythology may provide ideas for dramatic emotional content historical periods and awareness the clothes and etiquette those periods might challenge choreographers devise striking ways moving and there reason ignore the excitement contemporary life outside the dance studio course audiences have often had sigh over emotionally excessive dramatically lugubrious dances filled with grimaces pompous poses and frantic arm waving and such histrionics have turned both expressionist modern dance and ballets inspired literary classics however audiences today must their own sighing over musically based dances which the sounds the notes performers jump about with more precision than expression they were nothing more than metronomes with feet addition rousing fears that titles based scores may indicate restriction choreographic imagination such titles are bothersome simply because they are dull how can they possibly rouse audience interest anyone prosaic think tchaikovsky piano concerto more appealing than ballet imperial conceivably choreographers may not want reveal too much with their titles and thereby rob theatergoers the thrill discovering new work content balanchine himself may have occasionally wished surprise audiences one the most cumbersome and for anyone not fluent german unpronounceable titles the entire balanchine canon robert schumann davidsbuendlertanze that title simultaneously musically correct and emotionally neutral hinting nothing whatsoever about what goes this work from first the ballet appears depict people party then balanchine throws his surprises the choreographic tone gradually darkens until one realizes that this not just ballet about party but somber portrait man the brink madness first viewing schumann sometimes called can genuinely startling but once people see schumann any other work with comparable musical title more than once its content will longer new them fortunately however the choreography imaginative that schumann certainly the work may still thrilling then why settle for dull titles many occasions consider some titles other distinguished choreographers among the works the paul taylor dance company will present during its season city center opening feb are aureole black tuesday dandelion wine and speaking tongues here are more titles errand into the maze seraphic dialogue acrobats god and deaths and entrances martha graham jardin aux lilas lilac garden pillar fire undertow and echoing trumpets antony tudor and fancy free interplay age anxiety and the night jerome robbins such titles give few secrets away yet they may well stir audience interest since robbins set the night chopin nocturnes could have turned musical purist and called simply nocturnes not bad title but surely not quite appealing the night perhaps choreographers should take special care think about their titles and free themselves from balanchinan strictures the attempt devise good title either before during the actual choreographic rehearsal process might help focus their imaginations and prevent the completed piece from seeming fuzzy barak new telemann for instance was always gracious yet one could raise the faint complaint that whole was bit too unrelievedly mild what might have been the result she had titled with some word phrase that for her conveyed the essence what she sought reveal about the score would coming with such title have encouraged her brighten her choreography although dance nonverbal art the intellectual rigors search for title might conceivably help make dance work more choreographically vivid music not the only valid choreographic inspiration musical titles are not necessarily the best ones for dances and any case audiences will surely

general counsel the afl cio for two decades labor unions have criticized the trend which american corporations have moved away from defined benefit retirement plans that promised workers specific

towers were built markings were inscribed the steel columns indicate their exact positions but with the damage from the fire and collapse many those markings cannot found instead the engineers measure the width the steel the higher the building the thinner for example plates that are inch thick used connect columns were used only above the 80th floor the engineers who more typically are manhattan

beginning appear the horizon was glad there far the distance the ocean surged tall frothy waves that shimmered the warm horizontal light for few moments the beach was mine alone but then heard voices across the way two young surfers approached barechested the arms their wet suits flapping between their legs they passed close oblivious presence and deep conversation actually heard one them say bitchin waves man knew then dudes that was really the beach california close brush with surfer culture was only one the surprises during three days and nights venice and santa monica last month arriving the dead winter hadn expected find much anything save beach walk and some nice sunsets perhaps accompanied glass vintage cabernet and that would have been just fine but impromptu trip yielded

from hot warm lukewarm cooler whoa out here wouldn nice able have all hot water all the time well plumbers and energy efficiency experts say possible the breakthrough called tankless hot water and while the equipment costs more than traditional system lasts much longer and the operating costs are usually lower the person who invented tank type hot water heaters invented the car you never turn off your engine said kyle murray marketing director for the controlled energy corp distributor tankless hot water heaters waitsfield while murray analogy may stretched bit illustrates the basic difference between tankless water heaters and those cylindrical gas electric hot water heating and storage tanks many homes with standard tank type heater murray said the water the tank heated preset temperature usually degrees fahrenheit and then kept that temperature hours day whenever someone the house uses the hot water the gas electric heating element the tank switches heat the cold water replenishing the tank and bring the temperature the entire tank back the desired setting but the work tank type water heater not limited times that the hot water tap open murray said since even the most efficient hot water storage tanks lose heat when they are not being used the heating element works day and night keep the water the tank hot and ready for use stored water tank type heater loses much percent its heat the flue gas fired system murray said adding that while electric water heaters lose less heat because they not have flue such heaters are typically more expensive operate than gas units murray said that most tankless water heaters have copper heat exchangers through which the water flows being used instead maintaining preset temperature switching and off throughout the day however tankless hot water heater produces heat only when water flowing explained that when the hot water tap sink appliance turned the flow water activates switch that turns the heating element that element which can electric powered fueled natural propane gas then heats the water passing through the heat exchanger for long the water continues flowing result with appropriately sized tankless hot water system there will virtually endless supply heated water carsten ginsburg president empowerco alternative energy systems company summit said that gas powered tankless water heater can percent more energy efficient than gas powered tank type heater and percent more energy efficient than electric unit and while the standard pilot light used some tankless heaters can reduce the appliance energy efficiency newer tankless heaters have either hard wired battery powered electric pilots that produce spark ignite the gas when the unit switches among the other advantages tankless hot water heaters ginsberg said are their longevity tankless units can operate for years without requiring service while tank type heaters generally have replaced every years great tankless hot water heaters may seem however they have some shortcomings henry gifford president gifford fuel savings inc manhattan heating and ventilation design and consulting company said for example that while tankless heaters can indeed supply seemingly endless amount hot water they can only the unit properly sized for the demand will subjected gifford explained that since tankless heater heats only water passing through the flow rate the unit critical tankless heater that has flow rate say gallons per minute should able quickly raise the temperature that amount water flowing through from about degrees degrees and then maintain that temperature for long the water continues flowing the problem however that when the flow water through such unit more than gallons per minute the water moving too fast heated the desired temperature gifford said dishwasher turned while person taking shower thereby increasing the flow water through the heater there possibility that the water temperature both the dishwasher and the shower head will lower than desired you have make sure that you have unit that properly sized for your house gifford said another problem with some older tankless heaters said that the flow water through the unit low the heating element has cycle and off prevent the water from becoming too hot that means that water temperature can terribly inaccurate gifford said offering his own automotive analogy like trying maintain the speed your car turning the ignition and off pointed out that newer tankless heating units the market eliminate that problem using modulating energy input technology with such heaters instead turning the heating element and off produce the desired temperature the unit instead increases decreases energy the heating element maintain constant temperature matter how much water flowing through the unit another problem with tankless heaters gifford said that they typically require larger vent hole than the tank type heaters they often replace result said install such unit the vent must enlarged from the standard inches diameter inches failure provide properly sized vent gifford said can result dangerous levels carbon monoxide backing into the house michael lamb certified energy manager for the energy efficiency and renewable energy clearinghouse service the department energy said that all tankless and tank type water heaters sold this country must tested for safety and should carry safety labels standard tankless hot water heater for one family house would cost about installed gallon replacement tank the other hand would run anywhere from installed since the cost operate the tankless units can year less than tank type heater with the actual savings depending the type fuel used and the efficiency the heater the price differential could

message cheery tone and patriotic flourish hardly befit the scowling public image moussaoui the man federal authorities believe was meant the 20th hijacker sept and when arrived pan international miami office last spring caused alarm customers who wanted spend few voyeuristic hours the simulator were not that unusual but within hours moussaoui arrival mid august the company training center suburban minneapolis employees realized that their new student was not some affluent joy rider said john rosengren director operations for the office moussaoui wanted technical classroom training familiarize himself with airliners asked questions about protocols for communicating with flight towers wanted learn fast and paid pulling wad cash roughly out small satchel soon employees began whispering that could possible hijacker the cash the middle eastern accent the fact that had very little pilot training and wanted significant amount training ground school and the simulator all these things together pointed the fact that this was significant concern rosengren said the email message obtained the new york times and interviews with officials pan international provide the most detailed picture yet the school encounter with moussaoui the initial suspicion academy officials led moussaoui arrest and launched government investigation that came tantalizingly close unmasking man now accused the government being conspirator the sept attacks and possibly the plot itself moussaoui french citizen facing the death penalty conspiracy charges trial scheduled for oct district court alexandria his case has been particularly agonizing for federal law enforcement officials since was taken into custody nearly month before the attacks yet investigators could never piece together what was about happen for more than four months rosengren and other company officials have repeatedly rebuffed requests for interviews but they agreed talk thursday about moussaoui after the times obtained the email message and asked them comment rosengren said his staff had assumed the whole matter had ended after moussaoui was detained august said was contacted the fbi shortly after sept and told that moussaoui was suspect was then for the first time that rosengren read the email message sent the miami office back may had read prior sept probably wouldn have stuck out mind said but hindsight said the idealistic language infuriated him made angry said was like slap the face america even the message end once seemingly innocuous now seemed grating have nice day moussaoui wrote waiting for positive fly thanks you zac the may date the message which cited the federal indictment against moussaoui suggests that probably sent from norman okla where was concluding three months pilot training airman flight school had come oklahoma from london visa and his training had not been success had failed earn private pilot license because had never flown solo despite more than hours the air with instructor even his desire for simulator training meant that had look elsewhere and pan international which advertises widely made for obvious choice with centers across the country pan international the second largest flight academy the country begin optional trim his message moussaoui conceded his lack experience but suggested that was more interested training than earning professional certification sense able pilot one these big bird even not real professional pilot wrote his goals was vague about which the big airliners interested him the most ticking off list that ranged from boeing airbus noting that his choice for training would depend the cost and which one easiest learn but was specific the skills hoped master the level would like achieve able takeoff and land handle communication with atc wrote referring air traffic control able successfully navigate from jfk heathrow for example end optional trim marilyn ladner corporate vice president for pan international said the salesperson who received the email message and helped book moussaoui for training minnesota assumed was someone who could afford joyride simulator get doctors and lawyers and they got the money and something they want she said that not uncommon the price was and moussaoui used visa credit card make payment july followed payment the next day company records suggest that handled the transaction over the telephone july pan officials sent moussaoui via email his schedule classroom instruction aug and aug day off aug would then have hours training over four days flight simulator rosengren said had considered little out the ordinary that had requested the classroom instruction but that one had any reason suspicious before moussaoui arrived rosengren said first met the new student aug when moussaoui was paying the office finance manager some point had bag money with him rosengren recalled noting that settled cash his outstanding balance but moussaoui demeanor did not seem unusual seemed friendly the time had people show with quite bit cash before that wasn extremely unusual that same day moussaoui went another building called the commons where had his first session classroom instruction the instructor rosengren said immediately became concerned the instructor wondered why someone who was not pilot and had little experience was trying pack much training into such small amount time said moussaoui knew nothing about airliners and the instructor said seemed particularly interested flying once the plane was already the air was concerned about why were training him rosengren recalled the instructor the more was able talk him the more decided that was not pilot material the next morning aug the office held its monthly meeting instructors and administrators and moussaoui name quickly came instructors wondered why was interested learning the protocol for communicating with the flight tower when was very obvious that did not know how fly airplane especially something big that one manager the meeting said would willing contact friend who was agent the local fbi office about moussaoui other employees rosengren said even began questioning whether moussaoui could have been hijacker who could have tried take airplane filled with passengers there was discussion about how much fuel was board and how much damage that could cause hit anything added after moussaoui had finished his second day classroom instruction the manager with the friend the fbi asked rosengren for permission call him said ahead cannot remember the call was made the evening aug the morning aug but aug fbi agent accompanied immigration agent arrested moussaoui charges violating the terms his visa frank dunham one moussaoui lawyers would not comment when reached his office thursday alexandria the tip the flight school employees and moussaoui subsequent arrest prompted immediate though frustrating federal investigation agents learned that french anti terrorism task force had open file him but conclusive information linking him terrorist group like qaida other fbi agents visited the flight school oklahoma that moussaoui attended before coming minnesota counterterrorism officials fbi headquarters were aware moussaoui case partly because they had rejected requests agents minnesota examine moussaoui computer law enforcement officials said fbi counterterrorism analysts discussed the case least two secure conference calls that included their counterparts the cia and also consulted with the national security agency which eavesdrops communications around the world ultimately though moussaoui remained puzzle rosengren emphasized that single factor prompted his staff take action but rather accumulation small things and even when the decision was made make call said was considered precaution ladner the corporate vice president noted that the new transportation security act approved congress response the sept attacks provides previously nonexistent guidelines for how flight schools should deal with applicants like moussaoui salespeople processing email messages like the one sent moussaoui are now required determine

bright eyed dreamers staked their claims pass the word the starch back town government which was least theory supposed exiting stage right deregulation proceeded instead assuming many ways more central role than ever how energy new york and other states well notably california made distributed and sold the even keel for electricity supply that has been predicted for new york city this summer

which expected crucial july and august the same time state conservation and efficiency programs put together last year promise reduce electricity use during peak periods like hot summer days energy experts say giving new york important breathing room this year address its long term energy needs but the frontier mentality also the run for reasons that deeper than mere megawatts the terrorist attack september state officials said reinforced the connection between energy dependability and energy security which they say must the government province protecting the system through measures like diversification fuel supplies has become major element the state energy plan being completed this spring the same time the collapse enron which was considered the leading voice for reducing government regulation minimum has made fusty bureaucrats look good comparison california both its energy meltdown last year and its subsequent response with things like energy efficiency construction standards has further inspired those who think that more should rendered unto the public sphere and less the market the enron mantra that government can screw anything touches and markets are superior this argument longer has any credibility whatsoever said william hogan professor public policy and administration harvard kennedy school government who leading authority electricity regulation you stand after enron and and say something like that people look you like you crazy few experts suggest that the pendulum has shifted far that states like new york will reverse course altogether and return the old fully regulated monopoly days even they could most power plants that were owned utilities have been sold other owners for one thing but experts from fields varied environmentalism and economics say the momentum clearly toward government one industry official put with thumb the scale story can end here optional material follows historians say that the deregulatory tilt also had very broad social and economic forces behind many people probably now associate the beginnings deregulation the 1970s with the conservative get government off our backs mentality that propelled people like ronald reagan into office governor california and later president but crucial support also came from the political left said richard abrams professor history the university california berkeley who studies government business relations although business was irked pollution and affirmative action laws passed the late 1960s and early 1970s abrams said there was also groundswell opinion against big monopolies fueled the leftover social impulses the 1960s bell became object ridicule and was later broken ralph nader argued that regulation tended reinforce the status quo rewarding companies that were already connected now some energy industry officials say they fear things could tip too far the other way the rush regulation scares said william brier vice president for communication the edison electric institute trade group said that the industry task moment when people are anxious and things seem have broken down keep things perspective the enron scandal said about financial markets and accounting not about energy and electricity doesn have anything with said for the new government interventionists there also fine line walked the chairman the new york state energy planning board william flynn said that the terrorist attack last fall forced shift thinking about energy security the people formulating the state new energy plan which will released late spring early summer but flynn who also president the new york state energy research and development authority which administers million year fund for conservation and efficiency programs said his marketing efforts have drawn the line linking things like energy self sufficiency conservation programs directly public concerns about terrorist disruptions makes talking about these issues much more serious said but don have overt emphasis security the programs speak for themselves some electrical system administrators say that the current period quiet the electricity market new york with lower prices lower demand and adequate supplies forecast through the summer also heightens and complicates government responsibility keep residents and business leaders focused long term needs many power plants that were proposed for new york are now unlikely built because tightening the financial markets result the enron debacle and many ratepayers might not think about electricity when the lights stay and the bills don but that when falls government stand the mountain top and take the long view said steve sullivan spokesman for the new york state independent system operator which runs the state power grid new york state will need megawatts new power supply over the next five years said but the money and the will must committed now other experts say that government gets too much credit jerry taylor the director natural resource studies the cato institute research group washington that favors limited government and free markets argues that most state conservation and efficiency programs not really work all the real reason that demand was shaved off the peaks new york last year and the summer before which was far hotter was the rate structure taylor said the system allowed higher prices passed onto consumers that meant that when supplies got tight prices rose sending powerful economic signal customers especially big businesses that had the most lose cut back energy use california contrast price caps electricity kept cheap even during last year crisis which gave people and businesses little economic incentive conserve compounding the crisis taylor said new york the rate structure for utilities sends signals that many environmentalists say are also completely contradictory the state official goals because utilities like consolidated edison which serves new york city and its northern suburbs make their profits moving much energy through their wires they can they have interest best have conflicted interest having their customers using less electricity through steps like conservation under the old regulated system contrast utilities were rewarded for reducing demand now the state discourages conservation with one hand and encourages with the other the critics say the

top the line sierra light duty model the short bed extended cab denali this the same model that gmc called the last year although without four wheel steering the name was changed this year bring line with the top model the full size yukon and yukon sport utilities also named denali denali the eskimo name for alaska mount mckinley the highest mountain north america quadrasteer developed for delphi automotive systems the first application four wheel steering full size truck sure that catches with consumers will see other trucks and sport utilities such the yukon suburban and chevrolet tahoe can tell you after week the sierra denali list price plus transportation that the system works very well tight city driving conditions especially when trying make turn parallel park says quadrasteer cuts percent from the turning radius this short bed extended cab sierra pickup making just feet which almost the same the turning radius the compact saturn coupe feet there switch the dash turn the four wheel steering off into trailer towing mode turned off and tried turn the street front house and ran the sidewalk then turned and tried the same turn and completed with several feet spare parallel parking was much easier with the quadrasteer the rear wheels are turned electrically and their action computer controlled coordinate with the conventional hydraulic front steering the rear wheels don turn dramatically like the front wheels their turning just couple inches each direction but enough make major difference the vehicle handling computer control necessary because the rear wheels turn the opposite direction from the front wheels low speeds for easy maneuvering into parking places and such but they turn the same direction the front wheels highway speeds for quicker and steadier lane changes says trailer towing truly remarkable with quadrasteer although didn get try with quadrasteer the sierra denali and its trailer move down the highway they were one the company says and drivers can change lanes more quickly and safely with hardly any trailer sway even speeds mph and with pound trailer town quadrasteer allows the truck pull heavy trailer around corner without cutting the corner and also will let the driver maneuver the trailer more easily tight spaces like boat launching area campsite the driver supposedly can back the trailer without the normal right and left gyrations that accompany such maneuvers says off road the sierra denali can work its way around boulders and through obstacles that would stop conventional truck even without quadrasteer the sierra denali one truly fine truck with more bells and whistles included standard equipment than any other truck the market the specially tweaked vortec engine the denali cranks out horsepower which more than the engine creates other sierra models maximum torque foot pounds rpm more than the regular sierra this engine connected 4l65 four speed automatic transmission that has tow haul mode that changes the shift points accommodate trailer towing button the end the column mounted gear shift lever toggles the tow mode off among the denali other key attributes are full time all wheel drive this not

new nuclear age the early days the space program nasa looked into nuclear powered rockets possible means sending humans mars and other planets the agency tested some atomic rocket engines but abandoned the effort because missions arose use them the new program nuclear reactors would not directly produce thrust propel rockets the earlier program but would activated when far from earth supply power for other types engines the agency also developed electric generators powered radioactive materials that have been flown two dozen spacecraft including the pioneer and voyager outer planet probes and piloted apollo missions the moon the launching another probe with nuclear generator the cassini mission saturn drew protests from some environmental and antinuclear groups that worried that rocket explosion might spread radioactivity now only one these power units called radioisotope thermoelectric generators rtgs remain the civilian space inventory and officials say time reopen production lines the new program they say presents opportunity design and build new generators that are more efficient require less nuclear fuel and can used more varied spacecraft nasa proposing spend million over the next five years develop new types atomic powered generators supply electricity for spacecraft and also build nuclear electric rockets propel ships through space greater speed than possible with traditional rockets the nasa administrator sean keefe said nuclear power would help space explorers conquer the problems distance and time takes long time for spacecraft travel within the solar system said noting that would take more than decade for probe reach pluto using current technology the continued exploration the solar system and the space beyond being held back the limits conventional chemical rockets well existing spacecraft power supplies which mostly use solar powered cells keefe said officials said the nuclear program would conducted with

technology that will virtually eliminate any risk the public something goes wrong like launching accident will design these new systems for worst case scenario weiler said they designed survive rocket blowing one going and then coming down and hitting the ground you can guarantee this your design then don want talk you nasa officials said the systems they envisioned would launched conventional rockets and not activated until safely space once operating they said neither electric power supplies nor reactors powering engines would leave residual radiation still there some opposition the initiative the global network against weapons and nuclear power space group based florida said remained opposed any nuclear systems space and speculated that any new technology developed might applied military uses weiler said nuclear energy was not only safe but necessary for further space exploration the limits current power and propulsion systems are now starting limit space science said are

dome and because the rodeo had built the astroarena the county would build reliant center its new home for exhibits offices and the livestock show houston did not get nfl franchise the harris county houston sports authority would refurbish the astrodome last another years and another thing the rodeo wanted the football stadium included the baseball referendum the referendum research had predicted barely passed reliant stadium due open for the houston texans next season will have more seats than the dome and configured for football and rodeo the sightlines rule with unobstructed views and seats

opponents charged them with insincerity bit hypocritical said rep john boehner ohio they really believe the right thing why not now republicans plan offer amendment wednesday make the shays meehan bill instantaneously effective and force the parties return the soft money already collected the frenzied maneuvering promised produce topsy turvy and confusing house debate with each side promoting itself purer than the other passage more stringent bill would throw the house into compromise negotiations with the senate which last year passed bill nearly identical the shays meehan measure that

exploded was like cap gun going off said michael sailor professor chemistry and biochemistry who runs the lab where mikulec works was pretty shocking because this material work with every day was like floppy disk suddenly blowing the time sailor lab was trying create new sensors for computer disk drives introducing magnetic materials into specially prepared silicon chips but since mikulec accident has turned its attention toward computer chips that flames security conscious age explosiveness might not seem the most desirable property for microchips but sailor said that exploding chips could used develop new types portable chemical analyzers for biowarfare provide source power light for extremely tiny machines allow computers containing highly sensitive commercial government data self destruct they fall into the wrong hands concept sailor explosive chips owe much more gunpowder than high tech microelectronics created second cousin gunpowder said those who had misspent youth making gunpowder know that charcoal briquettes their own burn very slowly added but you grind some briquettes and add saltpeter you have explosive the fine grind the charcoal that makes the difference the chip that surprised mikulec had been etched create dense series microscopic channels introduce magnetic material into the chips researchers the lab poured solution onto the chips that when dried left gadolinium nitrate the channels what the lab had inadvertently created was situation which tiny channels had increased the surface area the silicon much the same way that grinding charcoal does for gunpowder the same time the gadolinium nitrate played the same chemical role saltpeter more properly potassium nitrate although one was hurt that first explosion for greater safety the lab began blowing chips remotely using volt battery and small electrical coil sailor said the researchers found the explosions were very fast and very hot and had about the same force equal amount gunpowder but being chemists they were particularly pleased that the light created the explosions was the ultraviolet portion the spectrum that has helped convince sailor that may possible create portable emission spectrometers for analyzing the chemical composition samples contaminants other compounds such analyzer would burn samples using explosions from the chips the only visible light would produced the chemicals the samples allowing easy and quick analysis and that sailor said would particular value the military dealing with chemical and biological warfare issues don want wait day and half for results from the lab said other labs have created explosions porous silicon wafers said but his view their approaches have practical shortcomings one group used very concentrated nitric acid but that very corrosive said you really don want carry around with you another relies liquid oxygen not the most portable materials among those interested sailor work kristopher pister professor electrical

satisfying sailor said that the least expensive and equally effective method dealing with the problem was simply calling the phone company and canceling service nor would exploding chips solve the

pedophile and gratuitous displays body fluids proved controversial that its distributor dropped the movie eventually was released unrated different company solondz wanted top that had his work cut out for him does top storytelling likely will fuel countless arguments among filmgoers but does accentuating traits many people found off putting about his previous movies almost enough make solondz partisan evaluate his other work for the record liked happiness and his earlier welcome the dollhouse yes solondz showed little compassion for his characters and extension the segment society from which they were drawn white middle class suburbanites still those movies were trenchant and funny works social criticism they made uneasy but that valid artistic strategy storytelling however solondz tries too hard make squirm its most awkward moments feels like movie the farrelly brothers would make only they were intellectuals instead mere smarty pants the film divided into two sections labeled fiction and nonfiction both sections are concerned with the construction and interpretation narrative and with issues exploitation the first set college creative writing workshop solondz sets the tone with the first scene the film opens with two college students having passionate sex one the lovely selma blair whom can tell gooder from her slogan blaring shirts not her choice sexual partners her lover marcus leo fitzpatrick who has cerebral palsy marcus smart enough know with him only because his affliction and not above using means keeping her wringing sympathy they break over her inability either truthfully evaluate his writing which frankly stinks defend him when criticized class setting out one night seeking hit and run sex with stranger winds with their imperious teacher african american man who seems contemptuous everyone there are many ways interpret their sexual encounter there are interpreters does scott robert wisdom cruelly and unconscionably exploit are his actions justifiable angry response the racial stereotyping and fantasies believes led her his bedroom does solondz portrait scott feed into noxious stereotypes the brutal hypersexual black male the filmmaker intentionally holding the stereotype force audience members confront their own attitudes and what did she get what she wanted was she silly uncomprehending racist who got the comeuppance she deserved hard tell solondz mocking white liberal guilt merely trying get rise out while having cold impersonal sex scott orders utter racial slur which she does first reluctantly then with rising intensity knowing whether she raises her voice anger passion both would help interpret the scene but can see her because solondz places large red block over the couple the filmmaker says obscured the scene because the movie ratings board refused give him rating unless made cuts opposed would have believe the red block political statement that may true certainly makes wonder given the explicit sex other rated movies whether the ratings board would have objected had the racial element not been present but how know the red block isn just ploy generate controversy and get attention the second story nonfiction longer about shoe store salesman named toby paul giamatti who decides make documentary about teen agers gloms onto sullen youth scooby mark webber new jersey high school scooby and his parents john goodman and julie hagerty cooperate with the documentary expecting favorable portrayal the first story isn easy for the audience decide whom sympathize with everyone the family except scooby overly concerned with social standing and they treat the hispanic maid horribly solondz uses toby character mock his own image criticisms people make solondz that deliberately portrays his characters and suburban life the cruelest light also apply toby opportunist with artistic pretensions both sections storytelling raise intriguing questions about who exploiting whom and about the nature creative expression they seem disconnected but they address some the same issues stories however they both feel thin solondz combined them into one movie and minutes short one because lost interest fleshing them out one the most interesting things about storytelling that directs our thoughts both inward consider issues central the creation and interpretation art and outward reflect race social values sex and economics hard think another american film that does that another american filmmaker except perhaps spike lee who would attempt that storytelling has value cannot denied not even solondz thirst for controversy sketchy characters and immature provocations can fully succeed cheapening storytelling starring selma blair leo fitzpatrick robert wisdom noah fleiss paul giamatti john

carbon dioxide and other heat trapping gases that his administration rejected march that time also abandoned campaign pledge cut power plant emissions carbon dioxide and three other pollutants not until now has his cabinet been able agree substitute proposals the treaty that bush rejected the kyoto protocol has been agreed but not ratified almost every other industrial power and developing country would require prompt and mandatory reductions gas emissions levels well below those bush rejected the treaty saying would burden the american economy and unfairly exempt major developing countries the plan bush announced thursday would rely voluntary measures only and allow gas emissions continue rise with the goal slowing the rate growth utilities and energy companies expressed

according one the most comprehensive reviews fishing ever conducted while some new england fish species seem increasing numbers the report funded the pew charitable trusts and released saturday boston said their recovery not telling the whole story north atlantic fish stocks are depleted that there are barely enough mature fish produce another generation the collapse fish populations occurring said the study because the population fish that people eat continues decrease while commercial fishing continues rise the north atlantic has about one sixth the number fish had and being fished eight times intensively scientists say fishermen are also chasing species ever lower the food chain bigger fish are depleted with few exceptions are going lose most fisheries the next decade don quickly mend our ways said daniel pauly university british columbia scientist who headed the study the group announced its results the annual meeting the american association for the advancement science may sound like doomsday scenario but the decline actually accelerating even where stocks are doing better they are still hovering the bottom pit pauly said the group scientists and about consultants undertook the year analysis after becoming frustrated the lack any oceanwide fisheries information the group composed fishery scientists biologists and economists from research institutions europe and north america most researchers and regulators tend focus only one species geographical area and little the information has been pieced together the scientists however did just that synthesizing millions numbers regarding fish species catches and populations over generations come with model the north atlantic while the scientists not have any power make policy their study expected weigh heavily with regulators decisions are made coming months further protect new england fish their proposed solutions are sure considered drastic many fishermen thousands square miles set aside take zones where fish are protected bears are national park large reductions fishing fleets and abolition most subsidies industrial fishing fleets fishermen many whom say stocks aren nearly imperiled scientists claim have faced increasing restrictions the last seven years regulators attempt rebuild scallop flounder and other species off new england patchwork closures limited fishing days and fishing gear that let more fish escape are now place just the last year the effort seemed pay off with the opening some scallop beds and cod plentiful lobstermen were pulling them traps unbelievable suggest the stocks are about vanish said david bergeron coordinator the massachusetts fishermen partnership association state fishing groups there are more fish out there now than there has been generation already have many closures areas fishing how many more they want once fishing off new england coast was the stuff legend georges bank ancient submerged island was considered one the most important fishing areas the world cod haddock herring clams and lobsters thrived there europeans came massachusetts part for the cod and until the 1990s the supply seemed limitless but overfishing led one fishery after another the 1990s being declared exhausted after cod and haddock were fished out fishermen began harvesting trash fish they used throw away such the spiny dogfish britain created hot market for that whitefish using fish and chip dinners soon however those stocks also collapsed and federal regulators came under fire for not doing their job help all fish populations recovery last month district judge gladys kessler ruled regulators weren doing enough prevent overfishing finding that could lead further restrictions authors the new study echoed the judge saying regulators have largely failed prevent overfishing large part because they looked fishing problem individual species not oceanwide one that essentially moving around the deck chairs the titanic said andy rosenberg university new hampshire dean who spearheaded the partial fishing closures georges bank when worked for the national marine fisheries services the last years the catch popular fish species such cod tuna and haddock has decreased more than half despite tripling fishing across the north atlantic the study found not just that there are more boats sophisticated technology also makes the fish easier catch countries spend billion taxpayer money each year search out the last fish left the north atlantic said rashid sumaila the michelsen institute norway who conducted economic analysis part the study the same time fish gets more expensive every year noted seafood prices especially for lobsters and shrimp have increased fold since new englanders can continue eat their favorite fish because much the seafood imported from developing countries practice that the scientists said should not allowed continue the national marine fisheries service one the prime regulators fishermen declined comment the report saying had not yet seen however mike sissenwine director the agency northeast fishery science center agreed regulators usually have not pushed for more stringent fishing restrictions because economic and social backlash from fishing communities the scientists saturday said regulators must ignore political and social pressure and what best for the ocean they suggest that most incentives and government aid for fishermen whether break fuel tax money for new boats abolished but the idea creating large protected areas the ocean that will upset fishermen most while the report scientists were unsure how large the take zones should they agreed each needed several thousand square miles effective just like creating park said rosenberg the areas have large you can get vibrant habitat that just the reality while closures exist the gulf maine and georges bank the scientists said they are too small worldwide less than percent ocean waters have such protection according the conservation law foundation that group and others recently conducted poll that found percent new englanders support protected zones but pauly said that such closures work only done tandem with reductions fishing pressure and warned against the urge reopen closed areas after stocks make initial recoveries rebuild again reopen and then fish again said pauly for example said while new england cod stocks are larger than they were years ago they are still dramatically lower than the 1960s you may think are making headway with few individual stocks but overall are unequivocally losing the battle manage fisheries the north

tied stock options and bonuses our economic recession mild and vastly different from what experienced the late 80s yet the decline tax revenues comparable what saw then said mike widmer president the massachusetts taxpayers foundation the principal reason the huge drop off taxes that were tied the stock market using estimates from economics professor alan clayton matthews and the state executive office for administration and finance the globe calculated that state revenue from these stock market related taxes will plunge from billion million this year one consultant who does forecasting for state governments said massachusetts could forced chop billion billion annually from its budget over the next three four years and that most isn ever going come back billion budget that would much

were before the answer capital gains taxes taxes paid when investor sells stock that has appreciated value soared from million more than billion last year the financial markets are expected grow more slowly over the next decade than they did the mid late 1990s and massachusetts has now fully phased change that makes investments held six years more immune the capital gains tax likely long time before capital gains revenue tops the billion level again the late 1990s were probably once lifetime event far the market concerned said mark zandi chief economist economy com forecasting firm west chester that juiced everything unprecedented heights that won see again for many years maybe even decades but capital gains aren the only disappearing vestige the boom state revenue exercised stock

for each share exercised time when cmgi stock was trading for about per share even though wetherell said never sold any those shares had pay immediate withholding taxes the difference value this example per share estimating the total tax revenue generated options and market related bonuses though difficult with precision since they reported ordinary income and not broken out separately like capital gains clayton matthews professor the university massachusetts boston attempts track tax revenue from exercised stock options and bonuses monitoring lump sum payments state revenue that captures withholding taxes from sources that don appear every paycheck primarily bonuses and exercised stock options most lump sum payments come the end the year the beginning the year during what clayton matthews calls bonus season during the mid 1990s lump sum income reported state tax returns totaled about billion during most bonus seasons which equates about million tax revenue for the state since was taxed percent the end the decade taxpayers were reporting more than billion each year lump sum payments which generated almost million despite tax rates that had then fallen percent clayton matthews said anticipates that the figures could return what saw the mid 1990s after couple years and then level off but capital gains taxes continued are unlikely come back anywhere near those magnitudes for the foreseeable future for many years that analysis proves correct state budget makers are facing the long term loss million more revenue from capital gains and another million from stock options and bonuses lawmakers set aside billion during the good years reserve fund which they can now tap help cover the shortfall widmer the taxpayers foundation said that was smart move that took great restraint the part elected officials but that will dwindle quickly given the expected funding shortfalls this year and next also said that many beacon hill haven yet adjusted the new reality that much the tax revenue not going come back soon the economy turns around you live the sword you die the sword widmer said now dying paying very high price for building those incredible capital gains into our growth expectations and for not anticipating just how steep the fall was going robert costrell research director administration and finance acknowledged the difficulty figuring our how much the revenue drop will return and how soon the task have try and sort out what are one time blips the data and what should get built permanently into the base costrell said that the

university whose bachelor degree from yale was psychology just talk somebody who buying for the first time and someone going through trauma frightening event big risk big investment campbell said means you going move taking all your money and more and putting into house more because you taking out mortgage into that standard tangle psychological tremors recent events have infused even greater degree uncertainty the stories the new york region manic residential real estate market the frenzied bidding wars tales fisticuffs the front lawn the champagne and brie bragging rites over newly snared penthouse the trauma the turndown have abated bit the more sobering circumstances the last five months yet now the past market observers from those wandering the halls higher learning the numbers crunchers their spreadsheets the brokers the phone still wonder what goes the minds potential home buyers recent years their hunches have come under more careful systematic scrutiny there increasingly prominent wrinkle the study economics something beyond the numbers the psychology finances the field real estate economics may well have surfaced the 50s with research paper that has long been considered classic that paper pure theory local expenditures charles tiebout economics professor northwestern university postulated that potential suburbanites really buy community first the package local services the schools their sense the neighborhood and then the house that observation perhaps not surprising now but those were the days when suburbs were just beginning encroach vast tracts farmland before they had become sprawling concern these days such studies fall under new designation behavioral finance discipline that looks macroeconomic concepts like loss aversion theory why people buy sell differently depending whether the market going down and price anchoring how during boom the recently outlandish price soon becomes acceptable and looks how micro you wouldn believe how peculiarly personal factors can sometimes influence home buying behavior broker tells woman who insists living near dairy barn harvard professor has written book titled sex and real estate the fireplace deal breaker was during the big real estate boom the late 1980s the one preceding the big boom the late 1990s and early 2000s that two economics professors were introduced mutual friend who knew they were both musing over the same question how buyers behave boom and postboom markets together they surveyed hundreds buyers across the country the answers were remarkably insipid actually said robert shiller yale university who with karl case wellesley college conducted the study they would report what they saw while driving shiller said things like there much traffic here many cars everybody wants live california and getting crowded prices have they would repeat stories about how hot the market was houses selling the first day and express anxiety that don buy now won able afford one later but nobody quoted any numbers any population extrapolations shiller said our uniform impression was that these buying decisions were not based careful analysis real people and the decision buy house inherently very emotional one while market players and observers obviously cannot quantify those individually internal factors they all agree that the housing market driven least much psychology economic fundamentals the same time personal though buying decisions may there certainly have been broadly embracing national and regional mood swings the market over the decades notes james hughes dean the edward bloustein school planning and public policy rutgers people respond least the short term cyclical swings and external shocks hughes said but the long term housing has always bounced back one the more ebullient sectors the economy the early 70s with inflation climbing housing was seen much better investment than stocks hughes said certainly better than your passbook savings account which had lower interest rate than inflation the psychology built that housing was the super piggy bank but from with the united states energy crisis housing slumped people had been moving into bigger houses hughes said the fear was whether those would turn out white elephants due the higher heating and cooling costs pessimism seeped deep into the market for average sized homes well had double digit mortgage rates plus percent hughes said people wondered about the death the american dream house real estate would roar again particularly our region the professor said had the great boom from and housing experienced probably its biggest price rise ever according the federal office housing enterprise oversight home prices across the nation jumped percent from and the new york region they skyrocketed percent housing ownership replaced sex everyday fantasy hughes said was the subject white wine and brie parties how much did the house down the street sell for what property worth now then came the worst recession for the region since the great depression lasted months the northeast through opposed eight months for most the nation during the boom years hughes said the new york region had built year supply office space speculation and that was true even for big condo and town house complexes that was followed vast bankruptcies among developers the collapse the amp industry then during the post recession early 90s housing was held more shelter than investment the notion was don overinvest housing said and people obviously put lot money into the stock market yet housing kept creeping back and prices reached and then surpassed their peak housing again became major obsession hughes said nowhere more than manhattan according one leading survey the insignia douglas elliman market report the median price for apartments manhattan increased percent percent and less than percent and when the stock market started tank year ago housing proved even greater winner hughes said was the safe port the economic storm story can end here optional material follows barbara corcoran one manhattan leading brokers and boosters has phrase for the frenzy that fuels booms pack mentality everybody likes buy when everybody buying and nobody likes buy when one buying said corcoran the chairwoman corcoran group pack mentality starts with shift buyers market which soon becomes snowball and then avalanche into sellers market corcoran said the craziness that everyone buying with their hearts and justifying with their heads they think but all really buying the crowd actuality the opposite she said smart people buy near the bottom when the market bottoms very few people have the courage out there and they are they the ones that make the steal deal shiller yale author that 1980s study buyer behavior argues that the media play part fueling pack mentality the media are promulgating optimistic stories shiller said not saying biased they report both sides but people are receptive the optimistic stories they just get more attention the stories people paying more than the asking price selling the first day house listed fistfights the front lawn said they great stories they resonate and they get repeated word mouth there natural process boom market which sustains the market for while and during the boom according behavioral finance theory phenomenon called anchoring comes into play when people have come with number for how much something worth they are easily influenced other numbers that they hear shiller said anchoring means that whatever value something has recently surpassed soon starts sound reasonable volatile market prices have gone lot said people think wouldn pay much for that house but hey might more pay much more than would have otherwise new york people say the prices are outrageous shiller said but they seen before starts seem they buy anyway because nobody really knows what the price should unfortunately that only works when prices are going added for sellers the primary psychological motivation loss aversion even the face current market conditions people make financial decisions differently assets that have declined value opposed assets that have increased value said chris mayer professor real estate the university pennsylvania wharton school mayer author with david genesove hebrew university jerusalem loss aversion and seller behavior evidence from the housing market article the november quarterly journal economics let say bought house and the housing market has gone percent mayer said now thinking selling and maybe somebody makes offer for gain percent typical homeowner would look that and say hey did pretty well but that homeowner actually did worse than the market still mayer continued they got offer for percent appreciation they would likely take and happy the key that decision the professor pointed out that the seller benchmark what she paid for the house not some index how houses that market have done recently down market the seller would probably react differently let say prices fall percent mayer said the seller got offer from someone buy for percent below what they paid matter how long before they would very likely turn down the offer and leave the house the market the hopes getting better offer this behavior odd most economists because believe people should benchmark performance against market indicator said the person who receives offer percent gain over their original price will view themselves being successful even though they done worse than the market but the homeowner where the market went down percent and the offer only percent down they will actually have outperformed the market what that means for the real estate market that least the start downturn many overpriced houses remain the market prices are sticky believe not that old economics term meaning they stay high even when demand has fallen mayer said eventually the number houses the market grows and the number closed deals declines sellers revise their prices downward many sellers however never drop their asking price enough and eventually withdraw from the market then when there new upturn houses start selling quickly because sellers are again accepting offers based what they paid sometimes decades ago and not the current market value loss aversion confounds classic economic calculations for the housing market too does the fact that pricing statistics are often months out date yet subject more recent mood swings real estate markets are very inefficient setting prices mayer said that because the comps the comparables used buyers and sellers are old news people look sales that went contract six nine months ago order determine today asking price you thought about buying selling stock you wouldn decide how much share ibm worth looking the closing price six months ago said but that what people real estate all the time and then they subject those
